      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map        of the great roads in New Brunswick. It was published by: C. W. Cottrell in 1858. Scale        approximately 1:511,000. Map in English. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced        to the surface of the earth and fit to the NAD 1983 CSRS New Brunswick Stereographic (EPSG:        2953) coordinate system. All map features and collar and inset information are shown as part        of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories,        text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal        map. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps        from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade        features. The selection represents a range of geographies, originators, ground condition        dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred        in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps        make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As        this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in        conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original        source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster        image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those        colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source      graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale      and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as          the accuracy of the published source map. The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the          result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the          original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and          georeferencing process. In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small          compared with sources of error in the original map graphic. The RMS error for this map is          1447.52 meters. This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the          different control points (links). The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of          the transformation. </horizpar>

        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a          high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder          capture software). Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas          or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using          cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was          designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are          faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the          originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up          1:1. Images in this collection were processed using: Adobe Photoshop/Aware JPEG2000          Content Creation Workstation. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce          storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. Color and tonal corrections were          made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was          performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 10.3, the digital JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points          located on digital vector shapefiles. For this image, the following vector shapefiles were          used as a base map for reference: ESRI World Imagery. The base map data is projected in          the NAD 1983 CSRS New Brunswick Stereographic (EPSG: 2953) coordinate system, and the          image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection. A world file (.j2w) was          automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. See 'Horizontal          Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image. Please note that the projection will need to be          defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world          file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>

      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing        the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent        relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography,        transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and        boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map        inset or collar.</eaover>
