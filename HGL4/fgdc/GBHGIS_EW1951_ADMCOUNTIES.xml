    <descript>
      <abstract>These are digital boundaries for the system of counties essentially created by the        1889 Local Government Act and continuing to exist until 1974. Their initial primary focus        was the administration of education. During the twentieth century, they can be treated as        aggregates of local government districts, although note that administratively County        Boroughs were independent of the counties they were geographically part of. This file        represents the system as it was used to report the 1951 Census of Population, and does not        separately identify County Boroughs.</abstract>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>These boundaries were created in four stages: (1)          Systematic digitisation of parish boundaries from Ordnance Survey county          administrative diagrams published c. 1910. Those maps are generally at          the scale of two miles to one inch, but the County of London was mapped          from maps at six inches to one mile scale. This work was mainly by          Victoria Gilham, working at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in          1997-9. (2) The 1911 digital parish boundaries were then modified to          create mapping of parish boundaries at later dates including 1951 by          Victoria Gilham in 1999-2000 at QMUL using (a) listings of boundary          changes in census and vital registration reports and (b) later editions          of the Ordnance Survey county administrative diagrams, which were          published approximately every 10 years. (3) Those parish boundary lines          which were also boundaries of Local Government Districts were selected          out, and any additional district boundary lines added, drawing on the          same sources. (4) The above work formed part of a single large system          which aimed to represent changing boundaries in continuous time, holding          boundary lines as individual arcs which were to be assembled into          polygon geometries using software written in Arc Macro Language. The          current polygon file tailored to a particular census date was created at          the University of Portsmouth in 2001-4, by Nick Burton and Paula Aucott.          The Local Government District boundary lines were selected out and          amalgamated to create Administrative County polygons based on the list          of Local Government Districts within individual counties given in the          1951 Census.</procdesc>
