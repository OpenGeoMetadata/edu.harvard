It was published by Smith and Coffin in 1857. Scale [ca 1:15,840]. This layer is image 2 of 4 total images, representing the southeast portion of the four sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the New Hampshire State Plane coordinate system (NAD 1983 in Feet) (Fipszone 2800).
