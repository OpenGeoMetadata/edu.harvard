All of the China placename features (including towns, administrative units, and natural features) have been stamped with their parent county names, prefecture names, and national standard code numbers (GuoBiao Codes) for those parent jurisdictions. The resulting files have been split into thirty separate layers, one for each Chinese Province (circa 1990). Chinese Characters are included for County level units only (GBK encoding). This data is derived from public domain GNS data, published by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (please consult GNS_COPYRIGHT statement, included with each layer). -- text from CHGIS v4 CD-ROM.",
