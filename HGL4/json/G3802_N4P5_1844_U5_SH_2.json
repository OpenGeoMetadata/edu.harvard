  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of New-York Bay and Harbor and the environs : sheet no. 2, founded upon a trigonometrical survey under the direction of F.R. Hassler, superintendent of the Survey of the Coast of the United States ; triangulation by James Ferguson and Edmund Blunt, assistants ; the hydrography under the direction of Thomas R. Gedney, lieutenant U.S. Navy ; the topography by C. Renard and T.A. Jenkins assists. It was published by Survey of the Coast of the United States in 1844-1845. Scale 1:30,000. This layer is image 2 of 6 total images of the six sheet source map, representing the southeast portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, buoys, beacons, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, bottom soil types, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, drainage, land cover, forts, selected buildings, towns, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Depths are shown by soundings and shading. Includes text, table of currents and stations, notes, sailing directions, 4 coastal panoramas and 2 views of Sandy Hook Light. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
