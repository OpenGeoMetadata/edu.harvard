Each county and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code that is unique within the state. These codes are assigned in alphabetical order of county or county equivalent within each state. The first-order divisions of Louisiana are parishes; Louisiana has no primary divisions, the entire area is considered equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/TG95LACTYPY.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:TG95LACTYPY\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:TG95LACTYPY\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-tg95lactypy\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Polygon\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2002-12-06T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"boundaries\", \"Census\", \"Administrative divisions\", \"County government\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Louisiana\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"1996\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1990\"], \"dct_isPartOf_sm\": [\"TIGER/Line Files, 1995\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-94.043341, -88.816516, 33.019544, 28.920521)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1990, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990074179590203941\"]}"
