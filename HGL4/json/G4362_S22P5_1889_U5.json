Enthoffer, E.A. Maedel, J.J. Young, W.A. Thompson, H.M. Knight, A. Peterson, and J.G. Thompson; red.r dr.ng by A. Lindenkohl, C. Junken, E. Molkow, E.J. Sommer. It was published by U.S.C. & G.S., printed March 15, 1889, corrected to April 12, 1889. Scale 1:40,000. Covers the San Francisco Bay Area. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the California Zone III State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 0403). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, buoys, beacons, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, bottom soil types, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, railroads, drainage, land cover, selected buildings, towns, and more. Relief shown by contours and spot heights; depths by soundings. Includes notes, tables, and list of authorities. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4362_S22P5_1889_U5.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4362_S22P5_1889_U5\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4362_S22P5_1889_U5\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4362-s22p5-1889-u5\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-01-09T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.\", \"Lindenkohl, A.\", \"Hilgard, J.
