ARC documentation states that: This Theme currently represents the transit component of the 2025 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). This dataset was originally produced in 1997 by Day Wilburn Associates working with various staff within the Transportation Planning Division (TPD) and the GIS Division at ARC. This Theme was created in ArcView using a variety of hardcopy sources where proposed transit projects were approximated during 'heads up' digitizing, using ARCmap, ARC's street centerline database and other datasets for spatial reference.
