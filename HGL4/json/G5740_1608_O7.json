  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Britannicarum insularum typus, ex conatibus Geographicis Abrah. Ortelij, cum privileg. decen., 1595. It was published by Giovanni Bapta. Vrintio in 1608. Scale [ca. 1:2,500,000]. Map in Latin. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'British National Grid' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also Italian text on map verso, Latin descriptions of historically significant locations, ornamental cartouche showing birds, and illustrations of ships. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
