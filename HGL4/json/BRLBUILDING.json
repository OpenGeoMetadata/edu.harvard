The original aerial photography was flown between 1990 and 1991 at 1' = 600' negative scale. The building footprints data layer was updated in 1996 with the addition of street addresses by Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. (CDM), based upon the addresses on the Assessor's map sheets. Digital planimetric data meets National Map Accuracy Standards for 1'=100' (1:1200) mapping.",
