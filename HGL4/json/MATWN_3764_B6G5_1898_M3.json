It was originally published in the Report of the Board of Metropolitan Park Commissioners, Jan. 1899 to 'accompany report of Olmsted Brothers, Landscape Architects, Dec. 1st, 1898.' Scale 1:62,500. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows local parks and reservations over one half acre, Metropolitan reservations and parkways taken or provided for, and proposed additions to the Metropolitan system. Features include parks, roads, railroads, drainage, town boundaries and more. Relief is shown by contours and spot heights. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MATWN_3764_B6G5_1898_M3.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MATWN_3764_B6G5_1898_M3\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:MATWN_3764_B6G5_1898_M3\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-matwn-3764-b6g5-1898-m3\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-05-12T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Massachusetts.
