  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, topographic paper map entitled: Cleveland and vicinity, Ohio. It was published by The Survey in 1956. Scale 1:24,000. Compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of the Mayfield Heights 1953, East Cleveland 1953, Cleveland North 1953, Lakewood 1953, Cleveland South 1953, Shaker Heights 1953, and Chagrin Falls 1953 7.5 minute quadrangles. Hydrography from U.S. Lake Survey Charts 35 (1:80,000) and 354 (1:10,000). The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Ohio North State Plane NAD 1927 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 3401). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 5 and 10 feet. Depths are shown with bathymetric isolines and soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
