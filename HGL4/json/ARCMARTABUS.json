ARC documentation states that: This Theme was created in ArcView using MARTA's digital road network as a base map for 'heads up' digitizing, where bus routes were 'traced' over existing arcs representing the various streets used by MARTA. The street base was originally developed by Navigation Technologies (NavTech) and converted for use within GDS, MARTA's GIS system. For the purpose of this CD, ARC's GIS Division adjusted many of the arcs to coincide with the MARTA rail lines and rail stations, and to improve the positional accuracy against the 1993 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quad (DOQQ) imagery. This Theme represents the initial release of MARTA's bus route system and does not reflect changes to routes effective March 23, 2002. Although this Theme graphically depicts all of the different routes in MARTA's bus system, there is currently no 'link' to tabular data that would describe these routes maintained by MARTA.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Restricted\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/ARCMARTABUS.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_restricted/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:ARCMARTABUS\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_restricted:ARCMARTABUS\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-arcmartabus\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Line\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2005-08-19T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC)\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"transportation\", \"Municipal\", \"Bus lines\", \"Buses\", \"Urban transportation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Atlanta\", \"Georgia (United States)\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2002\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"2001\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-84.670914, -84.102615, 34.109688, 33.516457)\", \"solr_year_i\": 2001, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990091531490203941\"]}"
