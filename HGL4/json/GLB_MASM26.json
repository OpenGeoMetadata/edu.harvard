  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a point coverage representing mine and mineral resource occurrence data worldwide (most thoroughly within the U.S.) and was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database. It was derived from the MAS/MILS (Minerals Availability System/Mineral Industry Location System) mineral location database. This database was transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Mines upon its closure in 1996. The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.",
