  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer delineates those areas afforded Outstanding Resource Waters classification under the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards of 1995. According to 314 CMR 4.00: 'Certain waters shall be designated for protection under this provision in 314 CMR 4.06(3) including Public Water Supplies (314 CMR 4.06(1)(d)1.). These waters constitute an outstanding resource as determined by their outstanding socioeconomic , recreational, ecological and/or aesthetic values. The quality of these waters shall be protected and maintained.' (March 1, 1995). The data here were originally produced by MassGIS; This layer was then derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. For more information on the original MassGIS datalayer please consult their website at: http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/orw.htm",
