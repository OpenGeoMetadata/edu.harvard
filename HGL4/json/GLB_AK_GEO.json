  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage with associated attributes representing geologic regions of Alaska. It is a digital version of the geology features of the 1980 Geologic Map of Alaska compiled by Helen M. Beikman, and prepared in cooperation with State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. It was published by the U.S. Geological Survey. This version of the datalayer was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database (2003). The map is a regional summary of geologic formations and units that can be shown cartographically at 1:2,500,000. This digital dataset includes all (184) map units from the original map. 182 are geologic units; the others are polygons for large glaciers and lakes. This coverage is not intended to be a complete representation of the printed geologic map. It does NOT include the following features: faults, locations of volcanoes or volcanic vents, the map explanation, correlation charts or description of map units. The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.",
