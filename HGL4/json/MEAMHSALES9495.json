"{\"geoblacklight_version\": \"1.0\", \"dc_identifier_s\": \"https://hgl.harvard.edu/catalog/harvard-meamhsales9495\", \"dc_title_s\": \"Massachusetts Median Home Sales Price, 1994-1995\", \"dc_description_s\": \"This datalayer displays a polygon coverage of Massachusetts town boundaries with associated attribute data on median home sales price changes for the years 1994 and 1995 for all towns except Buckland, Gosnold, Monroe, and Nantucket. These data exclude all condominium sales. Recovery in home sale prices since the last recession has been dramatically uneven among communities in the region. Prices have increased in high priced areas, while prices are still below their 1990 levels in low priced areas. 'Trade-up' homeowners from the large generation of baby-boomers are driving prices higher in more expensive communities, while demand continues to lag in the lower cost communities. This price differential may decline as the much smaller post-baby-boomer generation enters its prime home-buying years. Average home sale price for towns in the Metropolitan Area Planning Council region are provided for 1994 and 1995. This dataset was originally prepared and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MEAMHSALES9495.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MEAMHSALES9495\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:MEAMHSALES9495\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-meamhsales9495\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Polygon\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2004-04-07T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection\", \"US Census Bureau\", \"Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Massachusetts\", \"Massachusetts Office of Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS)\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"boundaries\", \"economy\", \"Real estate business\", \"House selling\", \"Real property prices\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2001-07\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1994\", \"1995\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-73.50824, -69.927802, 42.886818, 41.237962)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1994, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990073828550203941\"]}"
