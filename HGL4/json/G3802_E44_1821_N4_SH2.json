It was printed by W. A. Mercein in 1821. Scale [1:253,440]. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the western portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, cities and towns, county boundaries, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. Includes inset profiles: A profile of the extent of the levels and of the places and lifts of the locks between Lake Erie and the Hudson -- A profile of the southern route west of the Genesee River. Includes table of distances. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G3802_E44_1821_N4_SH2.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G3802_E44_1821_N4_SH2\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G3802_E44_1821_N4_SH2\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g3802-e44-1821-n4-sh2\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2007-11-27T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"New York (State).
