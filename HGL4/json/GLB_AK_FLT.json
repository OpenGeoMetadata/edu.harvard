  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polyline coverage with associated attributes representing geologic faults of Alaska. It is a digital version of the fault features of the 1980 Geologic Map of Alaska compiled by H.M. Beikman and published by the US Geological Survey. This version of the datalayer was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database (2003). The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.",
