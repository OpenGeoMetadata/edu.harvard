It was originally issued with Massachusetts House Document no. 18 of June 1814 -- petitions to incorporate Boston and Roxbury Mill Corp. Scale [1:15,840]. Covers portions of Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as selected roads (existing and proposed), propsosed tide mills and dams, drainage, canals, bridges, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MATWN_3764_B6N2_1814_D4.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MATWN_3764_B6N2_1814_D4\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:MATWN_3764_B6N2_1814_D4\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-matwn-3764-b6n2-1814-d4\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-05-23T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Dearborn, Benjamin, 1754-1838\", \"Massachusetts.
