  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays a polygon coverage of Massachusetts towns with associated tabular data on the average Scholastic Aptitude test scores of high school student test-takers in 1994. These data provide the average score figures for the 351 towns in the state. Verbal scores as well as average total scores (Math and Verbal combined) are provided for selected towns. NOTE: A significant number of communities did not report 1994 SAT scores. Towns without data may not have responded to surveys or may be part of a regional system. If 1994 scores were unavailable, 1993 scores were substituted if available. This dataset was originally prepared and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.",
