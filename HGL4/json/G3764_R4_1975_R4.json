  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the city of Revere, Massachusetts, drawn by Engineering Dept. It was published by the Engineering Department in 1975. Scale ca. 1:14,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also names of street, public buildings, and public spaces. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection.
