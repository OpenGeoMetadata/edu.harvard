  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Mukden = Fengtien. It was published by Southern Manchuria Railway in 1930. Scale not given. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM Zone 51N, meters, WGS 1984) projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, urban layout and buildings, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also index, legend, inset map of larger area, and 18 photographs around border. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
