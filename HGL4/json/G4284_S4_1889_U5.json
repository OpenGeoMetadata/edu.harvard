  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Seattle Harbor : Puget Sound Washington territory, issued May 1870 C.P. Patterson, superintendant; verification J.E. Hilgard, assistant in charge of the office; triangulation by J. S. Lawson assistant in 1874 based upon the primary triangulation by George Davidson, assistant in 1855-6; topography and hydrography by J.S. Lawson, assistant in 1874 & 5; resurvey of city of Seattle and water front by assist. J.J. Gilbert in 1886; additions by asst. Pratt in 1889; verifications of hydrology by Lieut. Comdr. W. H. Brownson U.S.N. inspector of hydrography. It was published by United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in July 1889. Scale 1:20,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Washington State Plane North Coordinate System HARN NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 4601). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, bottom soil types, flats, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, railroads, drainage, land cover, selected buildings, towns, and more. Relief shown by contours and spot heights; depths by soundings. Includes notes, tables, and list of authorities. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
