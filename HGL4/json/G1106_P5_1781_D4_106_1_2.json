  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the untitled, historic nautical chart: [A chart of Piscataqua Harbour] (sheet originally published in 1779). The map is [sheet 33] from the Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England, from surveys taken by Samuel Holland and published by J.F.W. Des Barres, 1781.

Covers coast of New Hampshire and Maine, from Portsmouth, New Hampshire to York Harbor, Maine. The image is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Mercator' (WGS 84) projected coordinate system. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more.
