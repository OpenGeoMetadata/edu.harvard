The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the WGS 1984 UTM Zone 33N (EPSG: 32633) coordinate system. All map features and collar and inset information are shown as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
