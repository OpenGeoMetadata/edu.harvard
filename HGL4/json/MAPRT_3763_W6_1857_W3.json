  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map set entitled: Vestiges of Assyria, by Felix Jones ; aided in the field operations by J.M. Hyslop ; engraved by J. & C. Walker. Map 2 entitled: Positions and plan of the ancient cities of Nimr?d and Selamiyeh, the former identical with the [Larissa] of Xenophon, perhaps the Calah of Genesis and ... of the cuneiform inscriptions. It was published by John Walker in 1855. Scale [ca. 1:12,000]. This layer is image 2 of 3 total images of the six sheet source map, representing the Mosul region Iraq. Map chiefly in English. Some place names given also in Arabic. This datalayer is compiled from two images of the six sheet source map that have been stitched together using image editing software to create a single image.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the European Datum 1950 TM42 (Transverse Mercator, Central Meridian 42) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as ancient city ruins, drainage, canals, cities, villages, and other human settlements, roads, fortifications, selected buildings, and more. Relief shown by hachures.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
