This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of the Civil War from the Harvard Map Collection.

These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features, in particular showing places of military importance. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
