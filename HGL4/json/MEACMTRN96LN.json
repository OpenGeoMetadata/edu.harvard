Each segment of track is coded with its owner, whether it is part of the commuter rail system, whether it is freight operative, and whether it is passenger operative. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. These data were originally compiled by the Center for Transportation and Public Safety (CTPS) from data provided by the Executive Office of Transportation (EOTC), the MBTA, and individual railroad operators; then supplied to MassGIS to create their 'TRAINS' datalayer. The ground condition reference date for this MassGIS layer is October, 1996. The Central Transportation Planning Staff updated and enhanced railroad linework distributed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as 1:100,000 Digital Line Graphs (DLGs). CTPS added several attributes pertaining to type of service, MBTA Commuter Rail status and stations, rail line ownership, and freight and passenger operation. MassGIS distributes these data as a single statewide coverage\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MEACMTRN96LN.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MEACMTRN96LN\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:MEACMTRN96LN\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-meacmtrn96ln\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Line\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2004-03-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection\", \"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census\", \"Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Massachusetts\", \"Massachusetts Office of Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS)\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"transportation\", \"Railroads\", \"Transportation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2001-07\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1996\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-73.427276, -70.128248, 42.87178, 41.509747)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1996, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990073828550203941\"]}"
