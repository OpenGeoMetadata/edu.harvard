  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage for Massachusetts towns which will display town boundaries and municipal revenues organized by type for each town for Fiscal Years 1900-1993. These data were generated from the Massachusetts State Policy Data Base which is collected and maintained at the Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research (MISER) at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. This layer was then derived for inclusion in the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. For more information on the definitions, data sources and process steps please read the 'Supplemental Information' and 'Data Quality' sections which follow. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
