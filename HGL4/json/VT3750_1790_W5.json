Scale not given. Covers northern Vermont including Grand Isle, Franklin, Orleans, Essex, Chittenden, Lamoille, Caledonia, Washington, Addison, Orange counties, and a portion of Rutland and Windsor counties. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Vermont State Plane Coordinate System (Meters) (FIPS 4400). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected buildings (residences, mills, forts, etc.), township and county boundaries, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
