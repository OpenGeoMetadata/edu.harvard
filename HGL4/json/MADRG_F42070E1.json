  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the 30 x 60 Minute USGS topographic map of the Gloucester, Massachusetts quadrangle, 1984. Scale 1:100,000. It is part of the Massachusetts 30 x 60 minute (topographic) series produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. The DRG was published in 1997. A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The source paper map was produced by the United States Geological Survey. Compiled from USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic maps dated 1966-1979. Planimetry revised from aerial photographs taken 1977 and other source data. Revised information field checked. Map edited 1984. The names of quadrangles which border this one appear in a table on the map collar in their respective positions (N,S,E,W) in relation to this map.",
