  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Nieuwe beschryvinge van Amsterdam met syne vermeerderinge, af-getekent door Daniel Stalpaert Stadts Architect. It was published by Frederick de Witt, ca. 1690. Scale [ca. 1:6,800]. Covers a portion of Amsterdam. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Dutch National Grid: RD (Rijksdriehoekstelsel) GCS Amersfoort (Bessel 1841) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, bridges, drainage, canals, wharves, docks, built-up areas and selected buildings, water mills, and more. Relief shown pictorially. Includes illustrations and indexes. Map text in Dutch and Latin. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
