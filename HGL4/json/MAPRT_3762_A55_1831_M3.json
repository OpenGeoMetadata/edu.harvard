It was published by Senefelder Lithographic Co. in 1831. Scale [ca. 1:25,500]. Covers the towns of Gloucester and Rockport, Massachusetts, with special attention on the Cape Ann coastline and harbors. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, public buildings, schools, churches, cemeteries, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), private buildings with names of some property owners, town boundaries and more. Relief is shown by hachures; Harbor depths shown by soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MAPRT_3762_A55_1831_M3.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MAPRT_3762_A55_1831_M3\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:MAPRT_3762_A55_1831_M3\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-maprt-3762-a55-1831-m3\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-04-14T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Mason, John.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Landowners\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Villages\", \"Land use\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"Administrative and political divisions\", \"Coasts\", \"Harbors\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\", \"Gloucester\", \"Rockport\", \"Cape Ann\", \"Gloucester Harbor\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2006-04\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1831\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-70.803511, -70.512511, 42.731929, 42.532581)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1831, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990059968740203941\"]}"
