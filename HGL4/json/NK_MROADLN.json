  "dc_description_s": "A polyline coverage which represents road transportation routes throughout North Korea. Roads included in this coverage are identified as Motorways, Major Highways, and Minor Highways. Highway arcs usually do not intersect Motorway arcs, and point locations in the North Korean administrative point coverages are not snapped to them. The point locations for such settlements have been snapped to highway arcs unless map sources show them to be located more than a kilometer or so from the highways.",
