The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the British National Grid coordinate system (British National Grid, Airy Spheroid OSGB (1936) Datum). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, selected private and public buildings, towns and villages, cemeteries, parks, farms, water district boundaries, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G5754_L7F7_1884_S3_SH_2.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G5754_L7F7_1884_S3_SH_2\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G5754_L7F7_1884_S3_SH_2\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g5754-l7f7-1884-s3-sh-2\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-01-14T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Standford, Edward, 1827-1904.\", \"Edward Stanford Ltd.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Water districts\", \"Water utilities\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"Administrative and political divisions\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\", \"boundaries\", \"utilitiesCommunication\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"United Kingdom\", \"London\", \"Barking and Dagenham\", \"Barnet\", \"Bexley\", \"Brent\", \"Bromley\", \"Camden\", \"Croydon\", \"Ealing\", \"Greenwich\", \"Hackney\", \"Hammersmith and Fulham\", \"Haringey\", \"Harrow\", \"Hounslow\", \"Islington\", \"Kensington and Chelsea\", \"Kingston upon Thames\", \"Lambeth\", \"Lewisham\", \"London, City of\", \"Merton\", \"Newham\", \"Richmond upon Thames\", \"Southwark\", \"Tower Hamlets\", \"Waltham Forest\", \"Wandsworth\", \"Westminster\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-01\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1884\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-0.314806, 0.1743, 51.602895, 51.390551)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1884, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990102324060203941\"]}"
