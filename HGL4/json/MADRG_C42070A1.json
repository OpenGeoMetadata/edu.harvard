  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the 1- by 2-degree USGS topographic map of the Boston, Massachusetts quadrangle (NK 19-4), 1970, covering portions of New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and a large portion of eastern Massachusetts including the Boston Region. Scale 1:250,000. It is part of the Eastern United States 1:250,000 series (1- by 2-degree quadrangles) produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. The DRG was published in 1997. A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The source paper map was prepared by the U.S. Army Topographic Command (RMPV) and published by the United States Geological Survey. Compiled in 1954 from United States Quadrangles, 1:24,000, 1:25,000, 1:31,680, and 1:62,500, 1897-1951. Planimetry revised from aerial photographs taken 1952. Map field checked 1955. Revised by the U.S. Geological Survey 1970. Selected hyrdrographic data compiled from USC&GS Charts. The names and numbers of the quadrangles which neighbor this one appear in a location diagram on the map collar in their respective positions (N,S,E,W) in relation to this map.",
