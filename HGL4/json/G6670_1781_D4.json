  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan geometral de la ville et de la montagne de Gibraltar : nouvellement corrige d'apres les originaux anglais, par L. Denis, geographe et auteur du Conducteur Francais, 1781. It was published by ches Basset in [1781]. Scale [ca. 1:1,111]. Covers Gibraltar. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the European Datum 1950, UTM Zone 30N coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, ship routes of attack, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortification and defenses, ship lines of fire, and other places of military interest for the Siege of Gibraltar, 1779-1783, ground cover, and more. Relief is shown by hachures; depths shown by soundings. Includes index. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
