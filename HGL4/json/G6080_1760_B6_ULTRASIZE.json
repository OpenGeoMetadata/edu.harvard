  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A map of the German Empire divided into its circles to which is added the Kingdom of Prussia : the whole laid down from the most accurate surveys and chiefly from the map of marschal de Schmettau, lately publish'd at Berlin by the Royal Academy of Sciences. It was published by: printed for T. Bowles in St. Paul's Church Yard and I. Bowles & son at the Black Horse, Cornhill between 1760 and 1769. Scale ca. 1:1,250,000. Map in English. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Europe Lambert Conformal Conic (EPSG: 102014) coordinate system. All map features and collar and inset information are shown as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of geographies, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
