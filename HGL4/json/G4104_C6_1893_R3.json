It was published by Rand McNally & Co. in 1893. Scale [ca. 1:20,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Illinois East State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1201). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.

Includes index to streets, avenues, and parks and list of railroads and their depots. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4104_C6_1893_R3.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4104_C6_1893_R3\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4104_C6_1893_R3\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4104-c6-1893-r3\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-03-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Rand McNally and Company.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Illinois\", \"Chicago\", \"Alsip\", \"Bedford Park\", \"Berwyn\", \"Blue Island\", \"Bridgeview\", \"Burbank\", \"Burnham\", \"Calumet City\", \"Calumet Park\", \"Chicago Ridge\", \"Cicero\", \"Crestwood\", \"Dolton\", \"Elmwood Park\", \"Evergreen Park\", \"Forest Park\", \"Forest View\", \"Harwood Heights\", \"Hometown\", \"Lincolnwood\", \"Lyons\", \"Merrionette Park\", \"Norridge\", \"North Riverside\", \"Oak Lawn\", \"Oak Park\", \"Palos Heights\", \"Palos Hills\", \"River Forest\", \"Riverdale\", \"Riverside\", \"Robbins\", \"Stickney\", \"Summit\", \"Worth\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-03\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1893\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-87.827848, -87.503501, 42.013785, 41.629183)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1893, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990102227080203941\"]}"
