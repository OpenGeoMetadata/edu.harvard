It was published by the Mississippi River Commission ca. 1895. Scale 1:10,000. Covers the City of New Orleans and adjacent portions of Jefferson and St. Bernard Parishes. This layer is image 4 of 4 total images of the four sheet source map, representing the northwest portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Louisiana State Plane Coordinate System, South NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1702). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, canals, drainage, vegetation/ground cover, land ownership in outlying areas, selected public, private, and industrial buildings, parks, cemeteries, Parish boundaries, ferry routes and more. Relief shown by contours. Detailed depths of the Mississippi River shown with soundings and dates of survey, and survey control points. River banks and bottom soil types shown. Includes index chart, list of authorities, and notes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4042_M5_1895_U5_SH4.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4042_M5_1895_U5_SH4\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4042_M5_1895_U5_SH4\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4042-m5-1895-u5-sh4\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2007-10-17T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"United States.
