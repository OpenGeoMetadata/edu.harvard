It was published by Cape Cod Commission in 1997. Scale 1:39,600. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the 2 sheet source map, representing the eastern portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, cities and other human settlements, public land, military areas, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also potential sites for wireless telecommunications facilities in Barnstable, Sandwich, Bourne, Falmouth, and Mashpee. Includes owners of potential sites. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G3762_C35P94_1997_C3_2.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G3762_C35P94_1997_C3_2\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G3762_C35P94_1997_C3_2\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g3762-c35p94-1997-c3-2\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2013-12-06T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library\", \"Cape Cod Commission.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Zoning\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Villages\", \"Landforms\", \"Bodies of water\", \"Land use\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\", \"planningCadastre\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\", \"Yarmouth\", \"Dennis\", \"Brewster\", \"Harwich\", \"Chatham\", \"Orleans\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2013-11\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1997\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-70.284701, -69.893114, 41.825624, 41.597728)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1997, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"12530785\"]}"
