  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan de Jedo capitale du Japon et residence du monarque seculier copie su l'original Japonnois de 4 1/2 pieds de long et d'autant de large qui est dan le cabinet du chevalier Hans Sloane = van vier en een halve Engelsche voet lang en zo veele breedt door J. G. Scheuchzer. It was published by Uytwerf in 1732. Scale [ca. 1:32,000]. Covers Tokyo, Japan. Map in French and Dutch. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Tokyo UTM Zone 54N coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected buildings, fortification, and more. Relief shown pictorially and by hachures. Includes illustrations. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
