Lecocq de la Fremondiere del. It was published by E. Andriveau-Goujon, Rue du Bac in 1866. Scale 1:200,000. Covers the Suez Canal region, Egypt. Map in French.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Egypt Red Belt projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.
