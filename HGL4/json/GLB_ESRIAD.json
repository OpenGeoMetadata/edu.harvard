Attribute data includes information on administrative region names, type, size (population) and country of location. The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Restricted\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/GLB_ESRIAD.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_restricted/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:GLB_ESRIAD\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_restricted:GLB_ESRIAD\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-glb-esriad\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Polygon\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-01-13T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Environmental Systems Research Institute (Redlands, Calif.)\", \"Geological Survey (U.S)\", \"American Geological Institute\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"American Geological Institute\", \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Administrative and political divisions\", \"Boundaries\", \"boundaries\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Earth\", \"Northern Hemisphere\", \"Southern Hemisphere\", \"Eastern Hemisphere\", \"Western Hemisphere\", \"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"Australia\", \"Europe\", \"North America\", \"South America\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2003\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"2002\"], \"dct_isPartOf_sm\": [\"Global GIS : global coverage\", \"U.S. Geological Survey digital data series\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-180, 180, 83.623596, -90)\", \"solr_year_i\": 2002, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990100637310203941\"]}"
