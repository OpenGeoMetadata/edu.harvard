"{\"geoblacklight_version\": \"1.0\", \"dc_identifier_s\": \"https://hgl.harvard.edu/catalog/harvard-measchrace9094\", \"dc_title_s\": \"Massachusetts School Enrollment by Race\", \"dc_description_s\": \"This datalayer displays a polygon coverage of Massachusetts towns with associated tabular data on the racial/ethnic characteristics of enrolled students per town. These data provide the public school 1990 and 1994 enrollment figures by race for the 351 towns in the state. The number of White non-Hispanic, Black (African American), Hispanic, Asian, and other minority students are given. The total number of minority students and the percent of minority students during the 1990 and 1994 school years have also been calculated. This dataset was originally prepared and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MEASCHRACE9094.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MEASCHRACE9094\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:MEASCHRACE9094\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-measchrace9094\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Polygon\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2004-05-05T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection\", \"US Census Bureau\", \"Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Massachusetts\", \"Massachusetts Office of Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS)\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"boundaries\", \"society\", \"Minority students\", \"African American students\", \"Hispanic American students\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2001-07\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1990\", \"1994\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-73.50824, -69.927802, 42.886818, 41.237962)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1990, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990073828550203941\"]}"
