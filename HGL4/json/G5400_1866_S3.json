  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A new map of Brazil : compiled from the latest government & other authentic surveys expressly to accompany the work on that country for William Scully. It was published by W. Scully in 1866. Scale ca. 1:7,750,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the SAD 69 / Brazil Polyconic projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also names of indigenous peoples, navigational notes, and names of mountain ranges and other physical features. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
