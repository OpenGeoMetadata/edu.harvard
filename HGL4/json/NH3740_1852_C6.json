  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the mountain and lake regions of New-Hampshire with rail-road routes, by M. Conant, engr. Cochecho R.R. It was published in 1852 by Sweit's Zincography. Scale [ca. 1:150,000]. Covers central New Hampshire from White Mountains to Manchester and Portsmouth. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the New Hampshire State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 2800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, selected buildings, drainage, county and town boundaries and more. Relief shown by hachures. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
