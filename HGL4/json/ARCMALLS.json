Attributes include: Names of largest (anchors) stores; mall square footage and location by city and street address. ARC documentation states that: This Theme was created from a list of malls in the Atlanta Region originally prepared for the 1997 Regional Development Plan (RDP) to identify major activity centers. The point locations of these malls were digitized in ArcEdit using a variety of data sources, primarily ARC's street centerline database (ARCmap). The locations are approximate centroids of the land area and include some proposed, as well as existing malls.",
