It was published ca. 1864. Scale [ca. 1:34,000]. The original map was created by salt print process. The layer image as presented here is a Photoshop inverse image version of a scan of the source paper map which aids in better exposing map features.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Virginia South State Plane NAD 1983 coordinate system (Fipszone 4502). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, land cover, fortification, selected public buildings and private buildings with names of property owners, and more. Relief shown by hachures. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
