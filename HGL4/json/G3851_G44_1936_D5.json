  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Base map of the District of Columbia showing public and zoning areas, base prepared in the Office of the Surveyor, D.C., by direction of the Engineer Commissioner, D.C. It was published by Engineer Commissioner in 1936. Scale [ca. 1:19,200]. Base map 'complete to June 13, 1933.' The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Maryland State Plane Coordinate System Meters NAD83 (Fipszone 1900). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as residential areas, open spaces, commercial and industrial areas, alley dwelling areas, roads, block numbers, railroads and stations, drainage, selected public buildings and points of interest, parks, cemeteries, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
