Extra information is added for properties split between two zoning districts. Newton GIS reports that, 'This data layer does not contain all these 'split-lot' parcels because the effort required is too great for present resources and interest. The split lots in this data layer were identified as the ones that had to appear on the zoning map.' This layer is NOT to be treated as an official zoning map at this time.",
