  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage of Massachusetts towns with associated tabular data on crime statistics per town between 1980 and 1995. This file contains town-level data on the number of specific crimes reported (CR) in 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995 and the number of crimes cleared by arrest (CL). These crime summary data were reported to the Massachusetts State Police from Massachusetts cities and towns, campus police departments, and other reporting agencies. Not all towns in the Commonwealth report their crime statistics. Crime rates per 1,000 town residents were determined for 1990 and 1995 using 1990 town population figures. Crime rates per 1,000 town residents were determined for 1985 and 1980 using 1980 town population figures. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. For more information on this layer please read the 'Supplemental Information' section which follows. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
