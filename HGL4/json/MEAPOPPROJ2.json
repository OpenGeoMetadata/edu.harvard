  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage which will display Massachusetts towns with associated data on population projections. The statistical data contained here were derived from MISER's (Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research) Analysis of Components of Change in Population Projections for Massachusetts. These projections are revised biennially, taking into account information about trends in migration, births, and deaths. For more information on the definitions and enumeration process please read the 'Supplemental Information' and 'Attribute Accuracy Statement' (under Data Quality) sections which follow. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
