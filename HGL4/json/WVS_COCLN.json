Features in this layer have an FACC (Feature and Attribute Coding Catalogue) Codes of BA010, defined as, 'Coastline/Shoreline or, the line where a land mass is in contact with a body of water' and ZD003 'Artifact Location. An indicator which identifies incomplete or illogical data at a specific location (node), used for data processing only.' The World Vector Shoreline (WVS) dataset was developed by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (formerly the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency - DMA) as a digital data file, at a nominal scale of 1:250,000 and referenced to the World Geodetic System (WGS-84) datum. The WVS is divided into ten ocean basin area files. VMAP data set products use the 'vector product format' (vpf) utilized first by the US Defense Mapping Agency and later by its successor, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA, now known as the NGA). 'VMap' is derived from 'Vector Smart Map.'\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Restricted\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/WVS_COCLN.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_restricted/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:WVS_COCLN\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_restricted:WVS_COCLN\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-wvs-cocln\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Line\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2005-02-22T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"National Geospatial Intellience Agency (formerly the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency - DMA)\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"East View Cartographic\", \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"boundaries\", \"Coasts\", \"Shorelines\", \"Landforms\", \"Hydrography\", \"Boundaries\", \"Continents\", \"Hydrographic features\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Caribbean Sea\", \"Antarctica\", \"Australia\", \"North America\", \"South America\", \"Africa\", \"Europe\", \"Asia\", \"Indian Ocean\", \"Atlantic Ocean\", \"Pacific Ocean\", \"Arctic Ocean\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2002\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"2002\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-180, 180, 90, -90)\", \"solr_year_i\": 2002, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990088996250203941\"]}"
