It was published in 1957. Scale 1:24,000. The source map was compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of Evanston, Park Ridge, Arlington Heights, Elmhurst, River Forest, and Chicago Loop, 1953 7.5 minute quadrangles. Hydrography from U.S. Lake Survey Charts 75 (1:120,000), 751 (1:60,000), and 752 (1:15,000). This layer is image 1 of 3 total images of the three sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Illinois East State Plane Coordinate System NAD27 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1201). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 5 feet. Depths shown by isolines and soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4104_C6_1957_G4_SH_1.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4104_C6_1957_G4_SH_1\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4104_C6_1957_G4_SH_1\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4104-c6-1957-g4-sh-1\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-03-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Geological Survey (U.S.)\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Maps, Topographic\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Illinois\", \"Chicago\", \"Lake Michigan\", \"Addison\", \"Arlington Heights\", \"Bensenville\", \"Des Plaines\", \"Elk Grove Village\", \"Elmhurst\", \"Elmwood Park\", \"Evanston\", \"Franklin Park\", \"Glencoe\", \"Glenview\", \"Golf\", \"Harwood Heights\", \"Itasca\", \"Kenilworth\", \"Lincolnwood\", \"Melrose Park\", \"Morton Grove\", \"Mount Prospect\", \"Niles\", \"Norridge\", \"Northbrook\", \"Northfield\", \"Northlake\", \"Park Ridge\", \"Prospect Heights\", \"River Grove\", \"Rolling Meadows\", \"Rosemont\", \"Schiller Park\", \"Skokie\", \"Villa Park\", \"Wheeling\", \"Wilmette\", \"Winnetka\", \"Wood Dale\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-03\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1953\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-88.030121, -87.486518, 42.148531, 41.877814)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1953, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990091426140203941\"]}"
