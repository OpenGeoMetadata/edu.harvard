All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, shipping routes, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also transportation network in and around the harbor, tourist attractions, public lands, and a legend. Includes inset on inner harbor. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
