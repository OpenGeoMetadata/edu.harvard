  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Town of West Hartford. It was published by Belknap & Warfield ca. 1890. Scale [ca. 1:14,200]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Connecticut State Plane coordinate system (NAD 1983 in Feet) (Fipszone 0600). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, public buildings, schools, churches, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), private buildings with names of property owners, building material type, town boundaries, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
