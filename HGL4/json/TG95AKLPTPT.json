  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays landmark point features for the state of Alaska. 'Landmark' is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location (KGL). A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence. The predominant feature classes represented in this layer includes military installations, airports or airfields, educational and religious institutions, state or local parks or forests, and mountain peaks. Other possible landmark features could include cemeteries, fraternities or sororities, golf courses, lookout towers, multi-household or transient quarters, custodial facilities, other types of transportation facilities or terminals, employment centers, open space and other special landmark designations for post offices, police stations and firehouses.",
