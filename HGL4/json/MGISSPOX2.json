  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a companion layer to the Soils (Polygons) datalayer and contains points representing 'special' or 'ad hoc' point features such as gravel pits, wet areas, bedrock escarpments and others for a portion of the state of Massachusetts. The soils datalayer has been automated from 1:25,000 published soils surveys as provided on various media by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). All soils data released by MassGIS have been 'SSURGO-certified ,' which means they have been reviewed and approved by the NRCS and meet all standards and requirements for inclusion in the national release of county-level digital soils data. Soil survey areas are roughly based on county boundaries.",
