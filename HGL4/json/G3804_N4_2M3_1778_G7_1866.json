  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: This plan of the city of New York (within the palisades which were erected in the year 1745) was made for the purpose of shewing the progress and extent of the Great Fire which happened in the year 1776, the number of houses that was consumed, and also the Fire of 1778. It was published by Common Council for Valentine's Manual of the corporation of the city of New York, for the years ... 1866. Scale not given. Copy of a manuscript map. Covers Manhattan below Chambers St. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, fire areas (1776, 1778), drainage, selected public buildings (churches, markets, etc.) and more. Relief is shown by hachures. Includes ill. and index to points of interest. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
