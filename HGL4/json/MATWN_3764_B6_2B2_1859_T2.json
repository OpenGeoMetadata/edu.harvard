  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Part of a plan presented to the Commissioners for the improvement of the Back Bay, [by] T. & J. Doane's Office, published in 1859. Scale [1:2,400]. It shows a plan for a 36 acre lake and surrounding area, Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts. This is an updated version of the 1854 ed. 'Amended for the use of the City: Boston, Janr. 5th, 1859.' The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads (with street and alley dimensions), drainage, property lots with dimensions, land ownership boundaries with names of landowners, parks, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
