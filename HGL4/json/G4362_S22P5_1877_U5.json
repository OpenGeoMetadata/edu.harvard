Bache, Superintendent of the Survey of the Coast of the United States ; triangulation by R.D. Cutts, asst. & A.F. Rodgers, sub-asst. ; topography by R.D. Cutts, asst., A.M. Harrison & A.F. Rodgers, sub-assts. ; hydrography by the party under the command of Lieut. Comdg. James Alden, U.S.N. assist. It was published by The Survey in 1877. Scale 1:50,000. Covers the San Francisco Bay Area. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the California Zone III State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 0403). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, buoys, beacons, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, bottom soil types, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, railroads, drainage, land cover, selected buildings, towns, and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights; depths by sounding, shading, and contours. Includes inset map: Sub-sketch of entrance to San Francisco Bay (Scale 1:400,000), and inset views: View of the entrance to San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz N.E. by E. 1/2 (by compass 10 miles) -- View of the entrance to San Francisco Bay from Yerba Buena Id. -- View of the entrance to San Pablo Bay from near Angel Id. Also includes text and tables. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4362_S22P5_1877_U5.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4362_S22P5_1877_U5\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4362_S22P5_1877_U5\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4362-s22p5-1877-u5\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-03-14T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"United States Coast Survey.\", \"Bache, A.
