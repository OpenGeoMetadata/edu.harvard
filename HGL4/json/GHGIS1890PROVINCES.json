  "dc_description_s": "These polygons represent 14 provinces existing in the German Empire in 1890. Since only Prussia used provinces as administrative units, the provincial dataset as a layer likewise represents the territorial extension of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1890. Two changes have occurred as compared to 1871: The province of Prussia has again been split into the two provinces of East- and West Prussia, and the capital city of Berlin has been created as a province in its own jurisdiction.",
