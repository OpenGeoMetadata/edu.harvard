  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the historic 15-minute USGS topographic map of the Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts quadrangle. The survey date (ground condition) of the original paper map is 1887, the edition date is 1894 and this map has a reprint date of January, 1898. A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is geo-referenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map.",
