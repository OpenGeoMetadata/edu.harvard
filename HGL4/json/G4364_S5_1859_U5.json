  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: City of San Francisco and its vicinity, California, U.S. Coast Survey ; topography by A.F. Rodgers, sub-assistant ; hydrography by the party under the command of Lieut. R.M. Cuyler, N.S.N. assistant. It was published by The Survey in 1859. Scale 1:10,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the California Zone III State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 0403). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, buoys, beacons, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, bottom soil types, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, railroads, drainage, land cover, selected buildings, towns, and more. Relief shown by coutours (20 foot intervals) and spot heights; depths by soundings. Includes table of references (public buildings, etc.). This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
