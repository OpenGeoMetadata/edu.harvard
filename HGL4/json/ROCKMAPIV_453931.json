Rock]. Scale 1:250,000. This layer image is of Sheet IV [of 10] covering a portion of the Yellow River (Huang He) region in eastern Qinghai Sheng, China. The map set details the route and surrounding environs of the Arnold Arboretum's 'Western China' expedition led by Joseph Rock, 1924-1927. The set covers a portion of the Yellow River (Huang He) region in south central China (Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan shengs (a portion of historic Tibet)). It shows features, labeled variously in English, Chinese, Wade-Giles transliteration, and Tibetan, including: rivers, streams, lakes, mountains, gorges, valleys, plateaus, plains, cities, towns, villages, provincial capitals, county seats, passes, monasteries, ruin sites, native tribe locations, and more. Relief is shown by hachures, spot heights, and landform drawings. The original manuscript map set is part of the Harvard College Library, Harvard Map Collection. 'Joseph Rock traced his travels for the [Arnold] Arboretum's [Western China] 1924-1927 expedition in a colorful, hand-drawn map entitled 'Ch'ing-Hai upper Yellow River expedition.' The pen-and-ink drawing was made on ten sheets that when joined form a single, irregularly-shaped map, approximately six by eight feet in size. The individual sheets are numbered, using roman numerals; on sheet VII is a second title, 'Choni Territory, Upper and Lower T'ieh-Pu country and route to Sung-Pan, J. F. Rock, 1925-1927.' Topographical and other features are identified using a combination of English, Chinese characters, Wade-Giles transliterations and Tibetan script. Rock's attractive cursive style and use of hachures, spot heights, and landform drawings to depict relief add character to the map.' -- Text from the Arnold Arboretum Web site.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/ROCKMAPIV_453931.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:ROCKMAPIV_453931\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:ROCKMAPIV_453931\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-rockmapiv-453931\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-10-30T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Rock, Joseph Francis Charles, 1884-1962.\", \"Simpson, William Ekvall, 1901-\", \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps, Manuscript\", \"Land use\", \"Infrastructure\", \"Human settlements\", \"Bodies of water\", \"Rivers\", \"Landforms\", \"Scientific expeditions\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\", \"inlandWaters\", \"transportation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"China\", \"Huang He\", \"Yellow River\", \"Qinghai Sheng\", \"Ch'ing-hai Province\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2006-10\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1925-1927\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(98.650791, 100.131649, 35.476566, 33.728784)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1925, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990089549770203941\"]}"
