  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic sheet map entitled: New York and vicinity : Plainfield, N.J.-N.Y., 1956. It is part of an 8 sheet map set covering the metropolitan New York City area. It was published in 1961. Scale 1:24,000. The source map was prepared by the Geological Survey from 1:24,000-scale maps of Roselle 1955, Chatham 1955, Plainfield 1955, and Perth Amboy 1956 7.5 minute quadrangles compiled by the Army Map Service. Culture revised by the Geological Survey. Hydrography compiled from USC&GS charts 286 (1954) and 375 (1953). The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD27 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. USGS maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 10 and 20 feet; depths are shown with contours and soundings. Please pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, sources, dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
