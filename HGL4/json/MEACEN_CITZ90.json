  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage of Massachusetts' towns populations organized by citizenship, foreign-born status, age group and date of entry to the United States. This data was extracted from the 1990 U.S. Census of Population and Housing STF 3A database published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It also includes Total persons per town, Total number of foreign born persons, and percentage of the Total population per town that is foreign born. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
