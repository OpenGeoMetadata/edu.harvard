Kiesling u. J.F. Winckler; Gestochen von A. K?hler. It was published by Verlag von H. Jaenicke in [1878]. Scale 1:15,000. Map in German.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz (DHDN) 3-degree Gauss-Kruger Zone 5 coordinate system.

This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, city districts, ground cover, and more.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
