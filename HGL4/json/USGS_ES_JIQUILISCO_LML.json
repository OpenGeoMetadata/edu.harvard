  "dc_description_s": "Transmission lines : lines of electrical pipelines for the Jiquilisco region, El Salvador. This layer was vectorized from original hardcopy 1:50,000 topographic maps produced by the Instituto Geogra?fico Nacional of the Republic of El Salvador from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s. Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America during the months of October- November of 1998. From 1998 to 2001 the US Geological Survey was involved along with other federal agencies in the reconstruction effort. The source CD consists of a compilation of GIS data layers and computer applications focused on hazard prevention and useful in municipal planning. Each dataset includes layers for a base area of one hundred square kilometers around the urban center of each municipality in the Hurricane Mitch project.",
