It was published in 1957. Scale 1:24,000. The source map was compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of Calumet Lake, Blue Island, Palos Park, Sag Bridge, Mokena, Tinley Park, Harvey, and Calumet City 1953 7.5 minute quadrangles. Hydrography from U.S. Lake Survey Chart 755 (1:15,000). This layer is image 3 of 3 total images of the three sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Illinois East State Plane Coordinate System NAD27 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1201). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 5 feet. Depths shown by isolines and soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4104_C6_1957_G4_SH_3.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4104_C6_1957_G4_SH_3\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4104_C6_1957_G4_SH_3\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4104-c6-1957-g4-sh-3\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-03-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Geological Survey (U.S.)\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Maps, Topographic\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Illinois\", \"Chicago\", \"Lake Michigan\", \"Alsip\", \"Argonne National Laboratory Reservation\", \"Blue Island\", \"Bridgeview\", \"Burnham\", \"Calumet City\", \"Calumet Park\", \"Chicago Heights\", \"Chicago Ridge\", \"Country Club Hills\", \"Crestwood\", \"Dixmoor\", \"Dolton\", \"East Hazel Crest\", \"Evergreen Park\", \"Flossmoor\", \"Ford Heights\", \"Frankfort\", \"Glenwood\", \"Harvey\", \"Hazel Crest\", \"Hickory Hills\", \"Homewood\", \"Joliet\", \"Lansing\", \"Lemont\", \"Lockport\", \"Lynwood\", \"Markham\", \"Matteson\", \"Merrionette Park\", \"Midlothian\", \"Mokena\", \"New Lenox\", \"Oak Forest\", \"Oak Lawn\", \"Olympia Fields\", \"Orland Hills\", \"Orland Park\", \"Palos Heights\", \"Palos Hills\", \"Palos Park\", \"Park Forest\", \"Phoenix\", \"Posen\", \"Riverdale\", \"Robbins\", \"Sauk Village\", \"South Holland\", \"Thornton\", \"Tinley Park\", \"Willow Springs\", \"Worth\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-03\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1953\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-88.026905, -87.488512, 41.732444, 41.463192)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1953, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990091426140203941\"]}"
