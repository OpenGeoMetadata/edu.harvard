  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the United States Geological Survey sheep map set entitled: Los Angeles and vicinity, East [and West], California. Edition 1953. It was published in 1956. Compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of the Burbank 1953, Van Nuys 1953, Canoga Park 1952, Topanga 1952, Beverly Hills 1950, Hollywood 1953, Inglewood 1952, and Venice 1950 7.5 minute quadrangles. Hydrography compiled from USC&GS Chart 5144. Scale 1:24,000. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map set representing the western portion of the map set. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the California State Plane Zone V Coordinate System NAD27 (in Feet) (Fipszone 0405). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. USGS maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 5 and 25 feet. Depth curves in feet. Please pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, sources, dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
