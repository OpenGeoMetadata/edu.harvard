Tabular data includes numbers of births; number of births for various maternal age groups; prenatal care and prenatal care funding statistics. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001.

This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
