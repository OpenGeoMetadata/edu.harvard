This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4104_C6_1910_B5.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4104_C6_1910_B5\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4104_C6_1910_B5\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4104-c6-1910-b5\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-03-04T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Blanchard, Rufus, 1821-1904.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Illinois\", \"Chicago\", \"Alsip\", \"Bedford Park\", \"Bellwood\", \"Berwyn\", \"Blue Island\", \"Bridgeview\", \"Broadview\", \"Brookfield\", \"Burbank\", \"Burnham\", \"Calumet City\", \"Calumet Park\", \"Cicero\", \"Countryside\", \"Des Plaines\", \"Dolton\", \"Elmwood Park\", \"Evanston\", \"Evergreen Park\", \"Forest Park\", \"Forest View\", \"Franklin Park\", \"Harwood Heights\", \"Hodgkins\", \"Hometown\", \"Justice\", \"La Grange\", \"La Grange Park\", \"Lincolnwood\", \"Lyons\", \"Maywood\", \"McCook\", \"Melrose Park\", \"Merrionette Park\", \"Morton Grove\", \"Niles\", \"Norridge\", \"North Riverside\", \"Oak Lawn\", \"Oak Park\", \"Park Ridge\", \"River Forest\", \"River Grove\", \"Riverdale\", \"Riverside\", \"Robbins\", \"Rosemont\", \"Schiller Park\", \"Skokie\", \"Stickney\", \"Stone Park\", \"Summit\", \"Westchester\", \"Willow Springs\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-03\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1910\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-87.893927, -87.506755, 42.046422, 41.619548)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1910, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990070170540203941\"]}"
