It was derived from NOAA polyline datasets representing the EEZ boundary for the East Coast, West Coast, and Gulf of Mexico. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 established a fishery conservation zone contiguous to the territorial sea of the United States, effective March 1, 1977. The outer boundary of the zone is a line drawn in such a manner that each point on it is 200-nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. The EEZ was established by Presidential Proclamation, effective March 10, 1983.
