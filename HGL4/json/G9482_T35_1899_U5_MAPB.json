  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of a portion of the untitled, historic paper map: [Kingsmill Group], corrected April 1873 at the Hydrographic Office Washington D.C. ; R.H. Wyman Commo. U.S.N. Hydrographer to the Bureau of Navigation ; eng. by Sherman & Smith, N.Y. It was published by the United States Hydrographic Office in 1889. Ed. of Mar. 1889. This dataset is georeferenced for the map entitled: Cook Island, Tarawa, or Knox Island, Kingsmill Group / by the U. S. Ex. Ex. 1841. Scale [ca. 1:150,000]. Covers Tarawa Atoll, Kiribati, The original map contains multiple maps on one sheet. Because the map images are non-contiguous and possibly at differing scales, each map image was georeferenced separately. Please see the 'cross references' section for other maps on this sheet.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'Mercator' projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any ancillary maps, inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows shoreline features such as islets, sand banks, entrances, and more. Depths shown by soundings. Includes profile view of Tarawa. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
