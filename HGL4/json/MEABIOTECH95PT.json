  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays a point coverage for biotechnology agencies and institutions located in Massachusetts as of 1995. This dataset was originally prepared by the Center for Labor Market Studies, Northeastern University, January 1996 and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The region that comprises the greater Boston/Cambridge area is well known for incubating emerging technologies. Biotechnology's primary products are pharmaceutical preparations, diagnostic substances, botanicals and surgical and medical instruments. As of 1995, the region's biotech industry consisted of 62 establishments with 20 employees or more. These firms are concentrated in Cambridge, suggesting an importance of proximity to the Massachusetts Institute of technology (MIT). As industry production procedures become standarized, emerging technologies often move to lower cost regions. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.",
