  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Wright's map of Kansas City, compiled and drawn by Carl Gothe de Grote ; engraved by H.R. Page & Co. It was published by H.T. Wright in 1884. Scale [ca. 1:10,000]. Covers portions of Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Missouri West State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 2403). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a partial cadastral map showing features such as roads, railroads and stations, drainage, selected public buildings, schools, churches, and industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), names of property owners, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
