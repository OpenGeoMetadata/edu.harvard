Scale [ca. 1:125,000]. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the western portion of the map. Covers coast of Massachusetts, Boston Harbor, and portion of Massachusetts Bay. The image is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Mercator' (WGS 84) projected coordinate system. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more. Includes also selected land features such as cities and towns. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection.
