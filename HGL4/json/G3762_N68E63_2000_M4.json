It was published by Metropolitan Area Planning Council ca. 2000. Scale 1:48,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as railroads, hiking trails, bikeways, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also watershed names and legend showing community open spaces, landmarks, and transportation routes. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G3762_N68E63_2000_M4.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G3762_N68E63_2000_M4\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G3762_N68E63_2000_M4\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g3762-n68e63-2000-m4\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2014-02-21T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library\", \"Metropolitan Area Planning Council (Boston, Mass.)\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Trails\", \"Open spaces\", \"Watersheds\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Villages\", \"Landforms\", \"Bodies of water\", \"Land use\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\", \"transportation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"North Shore\", \"Rockport\", \"Gloucester\", \"Manchester-by-the-Sea\", \"Beverly\", \"Salem\", \"Marblehead\", \"Swampscott\", \"Peabody\", \"Danvers\", \"Middleton\", \"Wenham\", \"Hamilton\", \"Topsfield\", \"Ipswich\", \"Essex\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2014-03\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"2000\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-71.129549, -70.459743, 42.775139, 42.358802)\", \"solr_year_i\": 2000, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990137515020203941\"]}"
