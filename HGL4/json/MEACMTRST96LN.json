This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. These data were originally compiled by the Center for Transportation and Public Safety (CTPS) from data provided by the Executive Office of Transportation (EOTC), the MBTA, and individual railroad operators; then supplied to MassGIS to create their 'TRAINS' datalayer. The ground condition reference date for this MassGIS layer is October, 1996. This file contains all the railroad stations for the entire state. Each station is given a CTPS id number. Unfortunately the name of the station is only provided for 95 of the 1307 stations. Additional names will be appended to this file as updates from CTPS are received.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MEACMTRST96LN.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MEACMTRST96LN\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:MEACMTRST96LN\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-meacmtrst96ln\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Point\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2004-03-04T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection\", \"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census\", \"Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Massachusetts\", \"Massachusetts Office of Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS)\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"structure\", \"transportation\", \"Railroads\", \"Railroad stations\", \"Transportation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2001-07\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1996\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-73.427276, -70.128248, 42.87178, 41.50989)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1996, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990073828550203941\"]}"
