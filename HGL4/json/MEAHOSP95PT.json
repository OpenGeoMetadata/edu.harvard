  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a point coverage displaying hospital names and address locations throughout Massachusetts. The user is cautioned to consider that since this datalayer was assembled (1994-1995) many mergers and facility closings have ocurred in the state and therefore some of the data here may not be accurate. The data was assembled using information from the following sources: Massachusetts Hospital Association, American Hospital Association, Federation of American Health Systems, and the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium. For more information on this layer please read the 'Attribute Accuracy Statement' (under Data Quality) section. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
