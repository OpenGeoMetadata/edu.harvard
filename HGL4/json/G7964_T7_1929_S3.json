  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Tokyo. It was published by Sankaku & Compahy [sic] in 1929. Scale [ca. 1:25,000]. Covers Tokyo, Japan. Map in Japanese (including romanized Japanese) and English. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Tokyo UTM Zone 54N coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a transportation map showing features such as electric car lines, railroads, railway stations, bus lines, drainage, selected buildings (temples, shrines, churches, embassies), and more. Includes index and inset: Map of Marunouchi. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
