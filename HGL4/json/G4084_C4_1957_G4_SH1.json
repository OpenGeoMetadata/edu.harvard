  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, topographic paper map entitled: Cincinnati and vicinity : Ohio -- Ky. It was published by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1957. Edition of 1955. Scale 1:24,000. Compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of Maderia 1953, Cincinnati East 1953, Cincinnati West 1953, Addyston 1954, Burlington 1955, Covington 1955, Newport 1955, and Withamsville 1953 7.5 minute quadrangles. This layer is image 1 of 4 total images of the four sheet source map, representing the northwest portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Ohio South State Plane coordinate system NAD 1927 (in Feet) (Fipszone 3402). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 10 feet and spot heights. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
