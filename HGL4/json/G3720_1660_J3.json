It was published by Ioannes Ianssonius (Jan Jansson) between 1660 and 1663. Scale [ca. 1:2,450,000]. Covers the northeast Atlantic States from Maine to Virginia, and a portion of Canada. In Latin. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Mercator (world) projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as human settlements, forts, Native American tribal lands, drainage, shoreline features, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. Includes illustrations. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
