  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Bacon's new map of the Witwatersrand goldfields in the districts of Pretoria and Heidelberg, Transvaal, S. A. R. : shewing the main and other reefs, with the farms, gold mining company's claims and concessions : from information in the Surveyor-General's Department. It was published by G. W. Bacon & Co. in 1895. Scale [ca. 1:88,992].The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM Zone 35S, meters, WGS 1984) projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, roads, railroads, cities and other human settlements, administrative boundaries, farms, homesteads, main reefs, other reefs, probable connections, and mills. Includes also notes and inset: 'Enlarged map of the farms Lanlaagte, Turffontein, Dornfontein & Elandsfontein, shewing the boundaries of the principal deep level gold mining coys. on the Witwatersrand goldfields' and a geological profile of the area north of Magaliesberg to the south of Witwatersrange.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
