  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Massachusetts town boundaries with associated tabular data on school enrollment. This layer displays annual public school enrollment totals from 1980-1994, as of Jan. 1 of each year for Grades 7-8. School-attending children include all residents attending any public school whether the schools are in their town of residence or not. This dataset was originally prepared and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council based on statistics produced by the Massachusetts Department of Education. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program. Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.",
