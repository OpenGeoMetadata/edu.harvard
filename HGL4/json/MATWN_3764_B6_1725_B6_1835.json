  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: The town of Boston in New England, by Capt. John Bonner, aetatis suae 60, 1722 ; engraven and printed by Fra. Dewing. The version imaged here is a 1835 facsimile (published by George G. Smith) of the third state (1725) of the original map published by John Bonner and William Price. Scale [ca. 1:5,600]. Covers Boston proper (Shawmut Peninsula and Boston Neck). The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, wharves, drainage, selected public buildings and residences (including schools and churches) shown pictorially, cemeteries, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. Includes an index to points of interest and chronological lists of 'Great Fires' and 'Genll. small pox.' This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
