  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Bathymetrical chart of the oceans, showing the 'deeps' according to Sir John Murray. It was published by the Royal Geographical Society in 1899. Scale [ca. 1:100,000,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Gall Stereographic' projection with the central meridian at 20.00000 degrees west. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by hypsometric tints. Depths shown by gradient tints. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
