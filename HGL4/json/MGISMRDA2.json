Many of the new roads were provided to MHD by municipalities on various town-scale maps. Also, MHD made edits to existing DLG features, in many cases using the MassGIS 1:5,000 digital orthophotography as a backdrop to better spatially position the linework. In addition, this layer includes extensive attribute information maintained by the MHD which has been linked to all features. The layer is up-to-date through 2001. By late 2003 the linework in this datalayer will be replaced with 1:5,000 Road Centerlines that were interpreted as part of the Digital Orthophoto development project. The MHD inventory and street attribute data will then be attached (conflated) to the larger-scale mapping.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MGISMRDA2.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MGISMRDA2\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:MGISMRDA2\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-mgismrda2\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Line\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-07-14T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"MassGIS (Office : Mass.)\", \"Massachusetts.
