This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The datalayer was originally developed by the Massachusetts Office of Geographic and Environmental Information (MassGIS) based on the designation of the 4 DEP regions and then implemented in the MEA. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
