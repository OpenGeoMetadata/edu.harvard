  "dc_description_s": "This point datalayer represents the bridge component of the FY2002-2004 TIP (Transportation Improvement Plan) which is a subset of the 2025 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). This dataset was originally produced in 1997 by Day Wilburn Associates working with various staff within the Transportation Planning Division (TPD) and the GIS Division at ARC. This layer was created by the ARC in ArcView using a variety of hardcopy sources where existing and proposed bridge projects were approximated during 'heads up' digitizing, using ARCmap ARC's street centerline database and other datasets for spatial reference. Refer to the ARC_ID number associated with each project and contact the Transportation Planning Division at ARC (404-463-3256) for additional information and for questions or comments on the TIP. Please note, not all TIP bridge projects are necessarily represented in this layer.",
