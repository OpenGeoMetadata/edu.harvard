  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of a portion of the untitled, historic paper map: [Islands of the Pacific], R.H. Wyman Commo. U.S.N. Hydrographer to the Bureau of Navigation. It was published by the Hydrographic Office in 1872. This image is georeferenced for the map entitled: Vatoa or Turtle Island and Vuata Vatoa, surveyed by Capt. Denham R.N. 1856. Scale [ca. 1:70,000]. Covers Vatoa Island and Vuata Vatoa, Fiji.The original map contains multiple maps on one sheet. Because the map images are non-contiguous and possibly at differing scales, each map image was georeferenced separately. Please see the 'cross references' section for other maps on this sheet.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any ancillary maps, inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows shoreline features such as islets, sand banks, reefs, entrances, tidal directions, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Depths shown by soundings.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
