ARC documentation states that: This Theme was created from ARCmap, ARC's centerline file that was the source for a large portion of the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER files for the Atlanta Region. ARCmap is an intersected model similar in concept to the TIGER files and is the outgrowth of the ACG and DIME files maintained by ARC for over 30 years. The features included in this Theme were identified by ARC's GIS Division as railroads based on U.S. Census Bureau CFCC code.
