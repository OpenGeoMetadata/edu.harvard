This map shows features such as exhibition grounds, roads, railroads, drainage, selected public buildings, built-up areas, parks, bridges, docks, and more. Includes explanation of railways. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
