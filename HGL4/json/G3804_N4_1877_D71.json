  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of New York City, south of 46th St. : showing new arrangement of docks, piers, and water frontage, also soundings and former high water line .... It was published by Matthew Dripps in 1877. Scale [1:7,200]. Covers southern portion of Manhattan. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as streets (with block numbers), railroads, drainage, selected public buildings (police stations, churches, theaters, schools, hotels, industries, etc.), wharves, parks, city wards, the former high water line, and more. Includes text: Key to r.r. routes, sub post offices, police stations, and street directory; and inset: New York in 1778. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
