  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Whitney's map of Seattle and environs, Washington, compiled from official records by O.P. Anderson and Co., engineers and draughtsmen, 1890. It was published by W.H. Whitney in 1890. Scale [ca. 1:30,600]. Covers portions of Seattle and surrounding cities. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Washington State Plane North Coordinate System HARN NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 4601). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, ferry lines, drainage, names of selected landowners, and more. Includes insets of the Seattle region and the state of Washington, and Union Pacific Railroad Co. logo. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
