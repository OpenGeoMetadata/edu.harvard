  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan of New Orleans, drawn and eng.d by W. Williams. It was published by W. Williams in 1849. Scale [ca. 1:31,680]. Covers also an adjacent portion of Jefferson Parish. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Louisiana State Plane Coordinate System, South NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 1702). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, canals, levees, drainage, selected public and industrial buildings, cemeteries, city municipality and Parish boundaries, and more. Includes a list of references. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
