  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Carte qui represente la parte meridionale du Bresil et du Perou, le Chili septentrional et le Paraguay : ce qui fait la partie de milieu de L'Amerique Meridionale, par le sr. d'Anville. It was published by P. Santini, Chez M. Remondini in 1779. Scale [ca. 1:6,500,000]. Covers the central part of South America including parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Map in French. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to a non-standard 'World Sinusoidal' projection with the central meridian at 58.000000 degrees west. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
