Smither, sculp. It was published in 1795 for Carey's American atlas. Scale [ca. 1:281,600]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, county and town boundaries and more.

The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
