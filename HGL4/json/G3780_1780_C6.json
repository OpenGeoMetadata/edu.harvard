The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Connecticut State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 0600). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, county and town boundaries and more. Relief is shown pictorially. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
