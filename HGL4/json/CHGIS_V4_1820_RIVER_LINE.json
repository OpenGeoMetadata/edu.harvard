Separate point and polygon GIS layers are provided for provinces, prefectures, and counties. An additional 8,000 towns and villages are provided as a point layer. The V3 1820 datasets have not been revised from V2, and are reposted here with the same filenames as the previous version. Spatial objects in the V3 1820 datasets retain the same SYSTEM_ID number that was used for them in previous versions. New with V4 are Coded Rivers, assigned Strahler Stream Orders by Mark Henderson. -- text from CHGIS v4 CD-ROM.",
