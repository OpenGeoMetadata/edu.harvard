  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage representing Massachusetts towns with associated tabular data on aggregate crime statistics per town in the year 2000. These crime summary data were reported to the Massachusetts State Police from Massachusetts cities and towns, campus police departments, and other reporting agencies. Not all towns in the Commonwealth report their crime statistics. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. For more information on this layer please read the 'Supplemental Information' section which follows. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
