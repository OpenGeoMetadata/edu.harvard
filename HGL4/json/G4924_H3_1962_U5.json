  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: West Indies, north coast of Cuba, Habana harbor (Puerto de la Habana), from surveys by U.S Navy to 1930 and by public works of Cuba to 1930 with corrections to 1941. It was published by Hydrographic Office under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy in [1962]. Scale 1:7,500.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'NAD 1927 Cuba Norte' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.This map shows coastal features such as lighthouses, buoys, beacons, rocks, channels, points, coves, islands, wharves, and more. Includes also selected land features such as roads, railroads, drainage, selected buildings, fortifications, and more. Relief is shown by form lines; depths shown by soundings, contours, and bathymetric tinting. Includes table of tidal information.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
