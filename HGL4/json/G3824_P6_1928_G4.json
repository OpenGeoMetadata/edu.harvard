  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, topographic paper map entitled: Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh quadrangle, Department of the Interior; U.S. Geological Survey; State of Pennsylvania represented by the Department of Internal Affairs Topographic and Geological Survey; H. W. Wilson geographer; Frank Sutton and Robt. D. Commin, in charge of section; topography by E.B. Clark, J.H. Wheat, A.C. Roberts and E.G. Hamilton; assistants J.S.B. Daingerfield and B.B. Alexander; and various town, city, and park surveys; control by D.H. Baldwin, W.R. Harper and R.W. Berry; river shoreline by U.S. Army Engineers. It was published by the U.S. Geoloogical Survey. Ed. of 1907, reprinted in 1928. Surveyed in 1903-1904. Scale 1:62,500. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Pennsylvania South State Plane NAD 1927 coordinate projection (in Feet) (Fipszone 3702). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown by spot heighs and with standard contour intervals of 20 feet. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
