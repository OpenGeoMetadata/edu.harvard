It was published by The Matthews-Northrup Co. in 1895. Scale [ca.1:40,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Pennsylvania South State Plane NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 3702). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, drainage, selected buildings, parks, cemeteries, city boundaries, and more. Includes references. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G3824_P6_1895_M3.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G3824_P6_1895_M3\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G3824_P6_1895_M3\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g3824-p6-1895-m3\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2009-01-14T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Matthews-Northrup Company.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Pennsylvania\", \"Pittsburgh\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2009-01\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1895\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-80.06372, -79.8673, 40.515762, 40.382736)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1895, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990099208210203941\"]}"
