  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a digital raster graphic of the historic 15-minute USGS topographic map of the Boston Bay, Massachusetts quadrangle. The survey dates (ground condition) dates for this map are 1886 and 1887. This map includes coverage of Cohasset, Hull, Quincy, Marblehead, Lynn, Swampscott and, in general, the coastal areas encompassing Boston Harbor and the larger area of the Bay. The Boston Harbor Islands are also depicted. A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map, including all map collar information. The image inside the map neatline is geo-referenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The horizontal positional accuracy and datum of the DRG matches the accuracy and datum of the source map. The names of quadrangles which border this one appear on the map collar in their respective positions (N,S,E,W) in relation to this map.",
