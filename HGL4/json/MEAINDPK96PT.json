  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer shows the locations of industrial and research parks throughout Massachusetts as of 1996. These parks were identified via a mailing to all regional and local chambers of commerce and regional planning associations. Only parks responding to the mailing are shown so this file represents only a selective sample of all industrial and research parks in the state. Parks that responded to the mailing were primarily parks that were less than complete in their development potential. More information about the individual park such as its building history, amenities, transportation and utility information can be obtained from the Massachusetts Alliance for Economic Development or from the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, Massachusetts Chapter (NIAOP). The Massachusetts Alliance for Economic Development is a private, non-profit partnership of business, industry leaders, and government dedicated to the economic growth of Massachusetts. This dataset was originally prepared and published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
