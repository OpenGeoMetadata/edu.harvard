This layer contains various types of nonvisible lines used to maintain the topology in the Census TIGER database. Non-visible features are used to delimit tabulation entities, property areas, legal and administrative entities. The U.S. Census Bureau separately identifies non-visible boundaries only when they do not follow a visible feature such as a road, stream, or ridge line. The predominant Census Feature Class Codes (CFCC) in this layer are: F10 (Non-visible jurisdictional boundary of a legal or administrative entity); F23 (Closure extension to complete database topological closure between extremely close features - used to close small gaps between complete chains and create polygons to improve block labeling on cartographic products); F40 (Property line, non-visible boundary of either public or private lands, e.g., a park boundary); F71 (1980 statistical boundary); F72 (1990 statistical boundary; used to hold 1990 collection and tabulation census block boundaries not represented by existing physical features); F73 (Internal U.S. Census Bureau use) and F81 (School district boundary).\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/TG95WYLKFLN.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:TG95WYLKFLN\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:TG95WYLKFLN\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-tg95wylkfln\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Line\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2003-01-10T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division\"], \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\", \"boundaries\", \"Census\", \"Boundaries\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Wyoming\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"1996\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1995\"], \"dct_isPartOf_sm\": [\"TIGER/Line Files, 1995\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-111.056888, -104.05216, 45.005904, 40.994746)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1995, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990074179590203941\"]}"
