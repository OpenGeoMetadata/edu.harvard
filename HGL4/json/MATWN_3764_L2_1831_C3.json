  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A map of Lancaster : reduced from the plan made by Jacob Fisher, Esq., from actual survey A.D. 1830, by James G. Carter. It was published by Pendleton's Lithography in 1831. Scale [ca. 1:29,700]. Covers the towns of Lancaster and Clinton, Massachusetts. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.

The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.",
