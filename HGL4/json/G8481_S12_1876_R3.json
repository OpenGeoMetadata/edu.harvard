  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of a portion of South Africa : illustrative of Lieut. Cameron's route from lake Tangayika to the west coast, by E. G. Ravenstein, F.R.G.S. It was published by Geogr. Mag. in 1876. Scale 1:5,000,000. Covers portions of Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Zambia. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to a non-standard 'World Sinusoidal' projection with the central meridian at 20 degrees east. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as expedition routes, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, and more. Relief is shown by shading. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
