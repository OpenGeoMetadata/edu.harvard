  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the United States Geological Survey sheet map entitled: San Francisco and vicinity, California, 1954. It was published in 1957. Scale 1:24,000. Compiled from 1:24,000 scale maps of the San Quentin 1947, San Rafael 1954, Point Bonita 1954, San Francisco North 1947, and San Francisco South 1947 7.5 minute quadrangles. Hydrography compiled from USC&GS charts 5532 and 5402. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the California Zone III State Plane Coordinate System NAD27 (in Feet) (Fipszone 0403). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. USGS maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with contour intervals 25 and 40 feet with supplementary contours at 5 and 20 foot intervals and spot heights. Please pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, sources, dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
