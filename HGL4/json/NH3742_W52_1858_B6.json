It was published in 1858 by J.H. Bufford. Scale [ca. 1:105,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the New Hampshire State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 2800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, selected buildings (dwellings, hotels, churches, schools, and mills), drainage, town boundaries and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. Mt. Adams and Mt. Jefferson shown transposed. Includes illustrations and table of distances. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
