  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Venice. Venezia. Venedig, drawn by W. B. Clarke; engraved by B. R. Davies. It was published under the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge by George Cox Jan. 1, 1853. Scale [ca. 1:10,750].

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the European Datum 1950 UTM Zone 33N coordinate system.

Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
