  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the untitled historic paper map: [Map of railroad lines from New York to Springfield, Mass.] showing the routes of the New York and New Haven Railroad, the New Haven and Northampton Railroad, the Hartford Railroad, and the Western Railroad. It was published by J.H. Bufford & Co. ca. 1850. Scale not given. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Connecticut State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 0600). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This is an outline map showing state boundaries, selected towns and cities along the railroad routes, and selected rivers and canals. Selected relief is shown pictorially. Includes a table of distances. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
