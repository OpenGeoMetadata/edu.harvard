Survey data was taken from 'the light house on Nantucket Point in 1784.' It was published and sold by John Norman, Feb. 10th, 1791. Scale [ca. 1:145,000]. Covers Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts and surrounding land. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This nautical chart shows coastal features such as lighthouses, rocks, shoals, currents, channels, points, coves, harbors, islands, and more. Depths are shown by soundings and shading. Land features include settlements, wind mills, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of Massachusetts from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates (1755-1922), scales, and purposes. The digitized selection includes maps of: the state, Massachusetts counties, town surveys, coastal features, real property, parks, cemeteries, railroads, roads, public works projects, etc.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/MAPRT_3762_N33P5_1791_P5.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:MAPRT_3762_N33P5_1791_P5\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:MAPRT_3762_N33P5_1791_P5\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-maprt-3762-n33p5-1791-p5\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-05-11T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Pinkham, Paul, 1736-1799.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Nautical charts\", \"Harbors\", \"Coasts\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\", \"oceans\", \"transportation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Massachusetts\", \"Nantucket Shoals\", \"Nantucket Sound\", \"Cape Cod\", \"Martha's Vineyard\", \"Nantucket Island\", \"Chatham\", \"Harwich\", \"Dennis\", \"Yarmouth\", \"Barnstable\", \"Mashpee\", \"Falmouth\", \"West Tisbury\", \"Tisbury\", \"Oak Bluffs\", \"Edgartown\", \"Nantucket\", \"Gosnold\", \"Aquinnah\", \"Chilmark\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2006-05\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1784\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-71.039494, -69.581016, 41.766857, 41.015647)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1784, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990095052530203941\"]}"
