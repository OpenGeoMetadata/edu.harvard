It was published in 1863 by Lith. of J. Bien. Scale 1:30,000. Nautical chart covering Charleston Harbor and a portion of Charleston, South Carolina. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the South Carolina State Plane Coordinate System (in Meters) (Fipszone 3900). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, houses, vegetation, drainage, military batteries and fortifications, coastal features (shoals, rocks, channels, floating batteries, etc.) and more. Overprinted to show 1/4-mile concentric circles centered on St. Michaels, Charleston; positions occupied by the Union Army and Navy; 'Rebel batteries in possession of National forces [and] batteries still held by the Rebels [on] Sept. 7th 1863.' Union positions are based 'on the authority of Maj. T.B. Brooks.' Relief shown by hachures; depths shown by soundings and shading. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of the Civil War from the Harvard Map Collection. Many items from this selection are from a collection of maps deposited by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States Commandery of the State of Massachusetts (MOLLUS) in the Harvard Map Collection in 1938. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features, in particular showing places of military importance. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/CW3912_C4S5_1863_U51.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:CW3912_C4S5_1863_U51\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:CW3912_C4S5_1863_U51\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-cw3912-c4s5-1863-u51\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2007-04-06T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"United States Coast Survey.\", \"Brooks, T.
