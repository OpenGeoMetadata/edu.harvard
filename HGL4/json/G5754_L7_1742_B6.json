All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.

Includes illustrations, tables of fares, and views: South prospect of London -- North prospect of St. Paul's Cathedral -- Bank of England -- Front of the Royal Exchange -- Banqueting House -- Treasury. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G5754_L7_1742_B6.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G5754_L7_1742_B6\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G5754_L7_1742_B6\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g5754-l7-1742-b6\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-06-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Bowles, John, 1701-1779.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"United Kingdom\", \"London\", \"Camden\", \"Hackney\", \"Islington\", \"Lambeth\", \"London, City of\", \"Southwark\", \"Tower Hamlets\", \"Westminster\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-06\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1742\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-0.157363, -0.063866, 51.530446, 51.48912)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1742, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990102094900203941\"]}"
