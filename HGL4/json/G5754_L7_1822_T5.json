  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A new map of London and its environs : from an original survey extending 8 miles east and west, 6 1/4 miles north & south, in which all new and intended buildings, improvements, &c. are carefully inserted, drawn by Mr. Thompson. It was published by Reeves & Hoare May 5, 1822. Scale [ca. 1:17,150]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the British National Grid coordinate system (British National Grid, Airy Spheroid OSGB (1936) Datum). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected buildings, built-up areas, parks, docks, city and borough boundaries, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. Includes 'Explanation of Colours'. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
