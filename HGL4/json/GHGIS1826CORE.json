In 1824 the principalities of Reuss-Lobenstein and Reuss-Ebersdorf were unified as a single state called 'Reuss-Lobenstein and Ebersdorf'. In 1826 there was a major redrawing of Thuringian boundaries due to the extinction of one of the dynastic lines, Saxe Gotha-Altenburg. Two states are refounded under new boundaries: Saxe Altenburg ruled by the former prince of Saxe-Hildburghausen, and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ruled by a new line of the House of Wettin, Saxe Coburg and Gotha, which later became connected to the British monarchy, founding in fact today's House of Windsor. Three states became extinct: Saxe-Hildburghausen, Saxe Gotha-Altenburg, and Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Saxe-Meiningen, finally, greatly extended its territory. - For the overall picture, see the description for 1820.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/GHGIS1826CORE.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:GHGIS1826CORE\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:GHGIS1826CORE\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-ghgis1826core\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Polygon\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2011-06-29T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"HGIS Germany (Andreas Kunz, Leonhard Dietze)\", \"IEG-Maps / Berlin Data Pool (Andreas Kunz, Robert Moeschl)\", \"Institut fur Europaische Geschichte (Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany)\", \"Fachhochschule Mainz (Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany)\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"HGIS Germany\", \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Political Divisions\", \"sovereign states\", \"boundaries\", \"Boundaries\", \"Administrative and political divisions\", \"German states\", \"Population Statistics\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Germany\", \"German Confederation\", \"Central Europe\", \"Germany\", \"Poland\", \"Kaliningrad Oblast\", \"Belgium\", \"Denmark\", \"Lithuania\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2007\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1826\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(4.819391, 23.157687, 56.025202, 47.056982)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1826, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990126902100203941\"]}"
