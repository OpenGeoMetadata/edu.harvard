This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, parks, park district boundaries, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/G4164_K2G52_1901_T8.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/mapimages_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:G4164_K2G52_1901_T8\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"mapimages_public:G4164_K2G52_1901_T8\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-g4164-k2g52-1901-t8\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Raster\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2008-01-24T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"Tuttle & Pike (Kansas City, Mo.)\", \"Board of Park and Boulevard Commissioners of Kansas City, Missouri.\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library\", \"dc_format_s\": \"GeoTIFF\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Maps\", \"Parks\", \"Human settlements\", \"Cities and towns\", \"Land use\", \"Landforms\", \"Infrastructure (Economics)\", \"Transportation\", \"Bodies of water\", \"imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Missouri\", \"Kansas City\", \"Kansas\", \"Kansas City\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2008-01\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1901\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-94.674811, -94.460357, 39.14721, 39.02363)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1901, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990111925780203941\"]}"
