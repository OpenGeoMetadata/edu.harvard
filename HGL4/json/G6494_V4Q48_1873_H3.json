  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: [Offizieller Plan der Weltausstellung 1873, Wien]. It was published by Eduard Hallberger in 1873. Scale [ca. 1:3,000]. Covers the grounds and buildings of the Vienna International Exhibition, 1873. Map in German. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the MGI 3-Degree Gauss Kruger coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, paths, parks, buildings, drainage, ground cover, and more. Includes index of major exhibits. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
