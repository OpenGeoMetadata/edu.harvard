  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: The city of New York drawn from actual surveys as furnished by the several city surveyors. It was printed in 1834 by Pendleton, lithographer. Scale [ca. 1:2,350]. Covers Manhattan below 24th St. This layer is image 4 of 4 total images of the four sheet source map, representing the southeast portion of the map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 18N NAD83 projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.

Includes index to points of interest. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
