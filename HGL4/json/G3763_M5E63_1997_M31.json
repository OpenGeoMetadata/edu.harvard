It was published by Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 1997. Scale [ca. 1:100,000]. Covers Framingham, Ashland, Sherborn, Hopkinton, Holliston, and Milford, Massachusetts.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.
