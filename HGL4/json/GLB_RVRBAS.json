  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage representing the Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database dataset: international river basins of the world. This version of the datalayer was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database (2003). Does not cover Antarctica. The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.",
