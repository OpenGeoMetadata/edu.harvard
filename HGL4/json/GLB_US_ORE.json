This data was derived from the Mineral Resource Data System (MRDS) data in ArcView Shape File Format, for Spatial Data Delivery Project, 1999 (Edition: Version 1.1) and was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database (2003). MRDS contains variable-length records of metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources of the world. A record contains descriptive information about mineral deposits and mineral commodities. The types of information in the data base include deposit name, location, commodity, deposit description, geologic characteristics, production, reserves, potential resources, and references. The Mineral Resource Data System master database is not accessible via the WWW. The large number of multi-valued fields make it difficult to import all the fields into a data format that can be utilized by the ArcView Internet Map Server Software. This dataset contains all MRDS locations, but only 44 of the possible 226 fields. A data structure was created in Access 97. Data was imported into the file structure and then processed into Arc View, where it was transformed into shape files that are used by the IMS software to serve the MRDS data and permit access via the www. The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Public\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/GLB_US_ORE.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wms\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_public/wfs\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:GLB_US_ORE\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_public:GLB_US_ORE\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-glb-us-ore\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Point\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2006-03-20T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"American Geological Institute\", \"Geological Survey (U.S.)\", \"Environmental Systems Research Institute (Redlands, Calif.)\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"American Geological Institute\", \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Geology\", \"Mines and mineral resources\", \"geoscientificInformation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Earth\", \"Northern Hemisphere\", \"Southern Hemisphere\", \"Eastern Hemisphere\", \"Western Hemisphere\", \"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"Australia\", \"Europe\", \"North America\", \"South America\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2003\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"1972-1998\"], \"dct_isPartOf_sm\": [\"Global GIS : global coverage\", \"U.S. Geological Survey digital data series\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-176.729722, 179.549167, 78.380556, -73)\", \"solr_year_i\": 1972, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990100637310203941\"]}"
