Mountains are the same for all centuries. They are represented as polygons formed by the contours of five different heights: 200m, 500m, 1000m, 2000m and 3500m. This layer is part of the Euratlas Georeferenced Vector Data collection that is composed of 21 maps, one for each century from year 1 to year 2000. These maps depict the detailed political situation of Europe at the first day of each centennial year C.E. from year 1 to 2000. Each map is composed of two kinds of layers: physical features layers, such as seas and rivers, and political features layers, such as states and cities. Some layers also cover adjacent portions of North Africa and the Middle East.\", \"dc_rights_s\": \"Restricted\", \"dct_provenance_s\": \"Harvard\", \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\\\":\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvard-library/harvard-geodata/main/fgdc/EURATLAS_MOUNTAINS_2000M.xml\\\", \\\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\\\":\\\"https://geodata.lib.harvard.edu/vector_restricted/wms\\\", \\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"https://mps.lib.harvard.edu/assets/files/hgl:EURATLAS_MOUNTAINS_2000M\\\"}\", \"layer_id_s\": \"vector_restricted:EURATLAS_MOUNTAINS_2000M\", \"layer_slug_s\": \"harvard-euratlas-mountains-2000m\", \"layer_geom_type_s\": \"Polygon\", \"layer_modified_dt\": \"2010-12-08T00:00:00Z\", \"dc_creator_sm\": [\"Euratlas-Nussli\", \"Nussli, Christos\", \"Nussli, Marc-Antoine\"], \"dc_publisher_s\": \"Euratlas-Nussli\", \"dc_format_s\": \"Shapefile\", \"dc_type_s\": \"Dataset\", \"dc_subject_sm\": [\"Mountains\", \"Landforms\", \"Contours (Cartography)\", \"Altitudes\", \"elevation\", \"geoscientificInformation\"], \"dct_spatial_sm\": [\"Europe\"], \"dct_issued_s\": \"2010\", \"dct_temporal_sm\": [\"0000-2000\"], \"dct_isPartOf_sm\": [\"Euratlas Georeferenced Historical Vector Data\"], \"solr_geom\": \"ENVELOPE(-9.147544999999999, 51.000548, 49.254279, 19.704495)\", \"solr_year_i\": 0, \"harvard_collectionID_sm\": [\"990114771850203941\"]}"
