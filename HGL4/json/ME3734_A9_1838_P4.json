  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan of the village of Augusta, Maine, shewing the Kennebeck Dam, and proposed improvements connected with it : from actual survey, by B.F. Perham, civil engineer. It was published in 1838 by T. Moore's Lithography. Scale [1:3,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD 83). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map is a partial cadastral map showing roads, drainage, cemeteries, parks, buildings and property boundaries with names of property owners, proposed canals, and lands of the Kennebec Lock & Canal Co., and more. Includes 2 profiles: Cross section of dam from C to D on plan. Scale [1:180] -- Section A to B on plan. Scale [1:1,200]. Horizontal scale [1:600]; and 2 ill.: North east view of the State House -- North west view of the insane hospital. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
