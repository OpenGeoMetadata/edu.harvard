  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Carta originale della Spedizione Borghese-Matteucci : nel Kordofan e Dar For secondo i rilievi del sottotenente A.M. Massari e le Esplorazioni anteriori, costrutta e disegnata da Guido Cora. It was published by Istituto Geografico Guido Cora in 1881. This dataset is georeferenced for the map covering the Darfur region, Sudan. Scale 1:3,000,000. Map in Italian.The original map contains multiple maps on one sheet. Because the map images are non-contiguous and possibly at differing scales, each map image was georeferenced separately. Please see the 'cross references' section for other maps on this sheet.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'Africa Lambert Conformal Conic' projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as exploration routes of Giovanni Borghese, Pellegrino Matteucci, and A.M. Massari (with dates of locations), drainage, cities, towns and villages, territorial boundaries, and more. Relief is shown by hachures and spot heights. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
