Technicians then begin a state-by-state editing process that includes (but is not limited to): Eliminating errant segments--Occasionally, we have discovered cases where the highway, as digitized, deviates considerably from the actual course. In these cases, GDT technicians digitize the correct segments and delete the erroneous ones.Feature reclassification--Another drawback to TIGER-derived files was their feature classification codes (FCCs). These codes were an attempt to classify streets and roads based on maintenance, a procedure that varied dramatically in different geographic areas. To correct this problem and create a consistent nationwide highway system, GDT reclassified almost every street and road in the nation based on its use.Highways names are applied according to a layered hierarchy. Where a highway segment has more than one name, the higher-level name will always be used, and always in this order: Interstates, then U.S. Highways, State Highways and Local Names.The data GDT uses to define highways and ensure completeness is culled from the following sources:· Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Lists all interstates.· U.S. Numbered Highways. Published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officers. Lists all state and U.S. highways.· State highway maps. Highway maps from state travel and tourism agencies and/or state departments of transportation.</procdesc>        <procdate>200201</procdate>        <srcprod>GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 12.0</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data set from GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 12.0.
