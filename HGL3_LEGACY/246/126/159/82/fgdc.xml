Other remarks: - For Azerbaijan the number of households, dwellings and purchasing power growth rate are not surveyed. - For Vatican City only total population and population density are surveyed. - For Andorra, Liechtenstein, Georgia and San Marino the number of dwellings and purchasing power growth rate are not surveyed. - For Gibraltar the number of dwellings, purchasing power growth rate and gross domestic product are not surveyed. - For Monaco and Kosovo the purchasing power growth rate is not surveyed. - In Russia only the European part of the country is surveyed (in accordance with the maps). Michael Bauer Research GmbH provided ESRI with:MBR - Economic and Sociodemographic Data for Europe and EuroBoundaryMap boundary data from EuroGeographics in the NUTS 0, NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3 shapefiles and table.</procdesc>        <procdate>2009</procdate>        <srcprod>MBR and EuroGeographics</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Started with the data in the custom package from Michael Bauer Research GmbH and EuroGeographics. The data included the four NUTS shapefiles and an Excel file that contained data for each of the four NUTS shapefiles. Converted the Excel file data into four geodatabase (.gdb) tables using Feature Manipulation Engine (FME). Joined each .gdb table to its corresponding NUTS shapefile. Added the arctic islands of Russia and Svalbard and Jan Mayen and the country of Armenia from AND Global Road Data to each of the four NUTS shapefiles. Coded their attributes with '-99' (null) values. For data sets NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3, added and coded the NUTS0 attribute. Renamed some attributes. Added the SQKM attribute to each of the four data sets and calculated its values. Converted the data sets to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices for each data set.</procdesc>        <srcused>MBR and EuroGeographics</srcused>        <srcused>AND Global Road Data</srcused>        <procdate>20090628</procdate>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps and Streetmap North America 9.3.1 (2009 Data Update) DVD.
