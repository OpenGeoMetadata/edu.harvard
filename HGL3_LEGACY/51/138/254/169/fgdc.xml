The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Tele Atlas North America, Inc.</origin>            <origin>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</origin>            <pubdate>200501</pubdate>            <title>Dynamap/2000 v. 15.0</title>            <edition>Version 15.0</edition>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Dynamap/2000</sername>              <issue>Version 15.0</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA</pubplace>              <publish>Tele Atlas North America, Inc./Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</publish>            </pubinfo>            <onlink>http://www.geographic.com/home/index.cfm</onlink>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>100000</srcscale>        <typesrc>DVD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200501</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>TANA/GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 15.0</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>U.S. Census Bureau.</origin>            <pubdate>2001</pubdate>            <title>Summary File 1 (SF1)</title>            <edition>2000</edition>            <geoform>tabular digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Summary File 1 (SF1)</sername>              <issue>2000</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>USA</pubplace>              <publish>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</publish>            </pubinfo>            <othercit>The Summary File 1 (SF1) data is based on the 2000 Census of Population.</othercit>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200004</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Census SF1</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted populated place areas from TANA/GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 15.0.

For Puerto Rico, put "-99" values into all number attributes (except SQMI) and "unknown" values into the CLASS attribute. Created regions (multi-part) based on combining the STFIPS and PLACEFIP attributes. Renamed attributes AREANAME to NAME, POPULATION to POP2000, and POP_CL to POP_CLASS. Removed attributes AREALAND and AREAWATER. Added attributes SQMI and POP00_SQMI and calculated their values.
