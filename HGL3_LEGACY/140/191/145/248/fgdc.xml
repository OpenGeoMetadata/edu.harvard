The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format in ArcSDE. This verifies and validates the geometry.</logic>    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files. The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</origin>            <pubdate>200201</pubdate>            <title>Dynamap/2000 v12.0</title>            <edition>Version 12.0</edition>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Dynamap/2000</sername>              <issue>v12.0</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA</pubplace>              <publish>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</publish>            </pubinfo>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>100000</srcscale>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <mdattim>              <sngdate>                <caldate>200201</caldate>              </sngdate>              <sngdate>                <caldate>1984-2002</caldate>              </sngdate>            </mdattim>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>GDT Dynamap/2000 v12.0</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>U.S. Census Bureau.</origin>            <pubdate>2001</pubdate>            <title>Summary File 1 (SF1)</title>            <edition>2000</edition>            <geoform>tabular digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Summary File 1 (SF1)</sername>              <issue>2000</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>USA</pubplace>              <publish>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</publish>            </pubinfo>            <othercit>The Summary File 1 (SF1) data is based on the 2000 Census of Population.</othercit>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200004</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Census SF1</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>U.S. Census Bureau.

The file was stored in SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.  ArcCatalog 9.1was utilized to export the SDC file to a shapefile and then loaded into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the command line importing tool "SHP2SDE".   Any shapes that were rejected due to bad geometry were fixed with the "Repair Geometry" tool in ArcCatalog.  These shapes were then appended to the ArcSDE layer using the SDE command line tool "SHP2SDE append".</procdesc>        <srcused>SDC</srcused>        <procdate>20060314</procdate>        <srcprod>Shape</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>1280 Massachusetts Avenue</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Vector</direct>    <ptvctinf>      <sdtsterm>        <sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype>        <ptvctcnt>35912</ptvctcnt>      </sdtsterm>    </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <geograph>        <latres>0.000001</latres>        <longres>0.000001</longres>        <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>      </geograph>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>        <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257222</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <detailed>      <enttyp>        <enttypl>ESRI04USPLACEPLY</enttypl>        <enttypd>The polygons represent concentrations of population that include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places identified by the U.S. Census Bureau.</enttypd>        <enttypds>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</enttypds>      </enttyp>      <attr>        <attrlabl>AREANAME</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The populated place name.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Names for the features.</udom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>CLASS</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The class of the populated place.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <edom>            <edomv>borough</edomv>            <edomvd>In Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, an incorporated place.</edomvd>            <edomvds>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</edomvds>          </edom>          <edom>            <edomv>CDP</edomv>            <edomvd>Census designated place - A statistical entity, defined for each decennial census according to Census Bureau guidelines, comprising a densely settled concentration of population that is not within an incorporated place, but is locally identified by a name.</edomvd>            <edomvds>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</edomvds>          </edom>          <edom>            <edomv>city</edomv>            <edomvd>An incorporated place in 49 States and the District of Columbia.
