County and county FIPS fields for the town of Bloomfield, CO were updated and it was listed as the county seat for Bloomfield County. County seats were added for counties where they were missing. Please note that Shannon County, SD; Todd County, SD; Kings, NY; Bronx, NY; Queens, NY; and Richmond, NY do not have official county seats.Incorporated place names were compared with those from the 2004 GNIS database. GNIS names were used where there were discrepancies. New incorporated places were added; duplicate points and places no longer incorporated were removed. Positions of all incorporated places were adjusted to match GNIS coordinates. Minor positional corrections of incorporated places were made using 1999 Hydrography Features of the United States and 1999 County Boundaries of the United States as references. The population range values were adjusted to reflect 2000 population figures and the POP_2000 attribute was added; earlier population figures were dropped.</procdesc>        <procdate>200402</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the compressed file from the National Atlas of the United States and extracted it.

For the records where FEATURE was "Populated Place", attribute STATUS remains blank. Removed attribute FEATURE. Renamed attributes FIPS55 to PLACE_FIPS, STATE to ST_ABBREV, and POP_RANGE to FEATURE. Renamed values of the new FEATURE attribute from "Undetermined" or "0 - 9,999" to "less than 10,000".
