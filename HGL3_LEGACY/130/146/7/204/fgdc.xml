There are two layers, one which contains the county seat (points) and the other county boundaries (polygons) that were within the jurisdiction of Songjiang, from it's founding in the 8th Century CE until 1911 CE. These layers are from the CHGIS Version 2 Time Series dataset. Time Series Data refers to GIS layers that contain many instances of spatial objects as they changed over time. Therefore, when spatial changes occurred to an object, both the previous and subsequent objects are included. Visually, this results in many overlapping objects, or "spaghetti," as it is referred to in GIS terms. For example, looking at two adjacent prefecture boundaries, let us presume that from Time 1 to Time 2 a certain boundary was valid. But at Time 3 a boundary change occurred. Because the boundary is shared by both the adjacent areas, it means that new objects are created for both areas. Therefore, instead of two objects we would have four objects. The changed portion of the boundary would show up as a distinct line, while the unchanged portion of the boundary would overlap the previous version.When dealing with Time Series Data it is necessary to keep in mind the visual ambiguity of the temporally distinct spatial objects, or "historical instances," which are all stored in a single GIS layer. It is necessary to do a selection of the objects by a particular year, in order to see the equivalent of a Time Slice.Time Slice Data refers to GIS layers that contain spatial objects representing a single year, or "slice in time." All of the 1820 and 1911 layers fall into this category.  When working with time slice data, all of the spatial objects are represented as the documentation indicates they existed for a particular year. Therefore two adjacent areas, such as two prefectures, would share a boundary, and by means of visual exploration of the data it is easy to distinguish one from the other.For more information on Time Slice and Time Series data, please access the "HOW TO" link at the following CHGIS website:http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/data/chgis/downloads/v2/The CHGIS will establish a database of historical administrative units for different periods in Chinese History, and will also provide a base GIS platform for researchers to use for spatial analysis, temporal statistical modeling, and representation of selected historical units as digital maps.</abstract>      <purpose>Developed by Fudan University, Center for Historical Geography, for the CHGIS project.The CHGIS project is designed to provide a GIS platform for scholarly and scientific research. Considerable flexibility has been designed into the GIS, allowing for alternate versions and variations of feature attributes, spatial data, and competing political entities. The CHGIS aims to build a reliable database of administrative units, but does not wish to impose a closed interpretation on the relationships among those units. The advantage of creating the CHGIS, rather than printing paper maps, is that the relationships between the units can be modified and improved whenever new information becomes available and the new "edition" needs only to be posted on the Internet for users to download. The CHGIS editors have set high editorial standards for the inclusion of material in the CHGIS data products and regulate the release of the official versions from designated CHGIS participating organizations.Users may search the database for settlements, administrative units and capitals, can create customized digital maps for particular times and places, or can join their own datasets for spatial anaysis, thematic mapping, or other specialized statistical modeling according to their own interests.</purpose>      <supplinf>The names of populated places in the CHGIS dataset are represented by both Chinese characters and Pinyin.  Chinese characters may not display properly on machines without the proper character sets installed. UTF-8 Encoding is employed for Chinese characters.Feature Types are used to classify the geographic features listed in the database. Since CHGIS is primarily concerned with developing a base GIS of administrative units and their changes throughout Chinese history, the feature types found in the current datasets are all historical administrative units, such as: commandery (jun), prefecture (zhou), prefecture (fu), county (xian), post road station (yi), and so forth. The feature types used so far are a sub-set of a much more extensive feature classification list, which has already been cross-indexed with the standard cartographic classification systems of China, Taiwan, and Japan.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <rngdates>          <begdate>751</begdate>          <enddate>1990</enddate>        </rngdates>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Revised (August 2003)</progress>      <update>As needed</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>120.858162</westbc>        <eastbc>121.902649</eastbc>        <northbc>31.850307</northbc>        <southbc>30.682426</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>boundaries</themekey>        <themekey>location</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Administrative divisions</themekey>        <themekey>Political divisions</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>None</themekt>        <themekey>Counties</themekey>        <themekey>Prefectures</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNIS</placekt>        <placekey>China</placekey>        <placekey>Shanghai</placekey>      </place>      <place>        <placekt>Dictionary of Chinese History</placekt>        <placekey>Songjiang</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>The CHGIS datasets are freely distributed for non-commercial academic research purposes.

The base map includes three contemporary layers circa 1990: Digital Map Database of China (DMDC) county boundaries; DMDC towns and administrative unit points; DMDC rivers and newly developed historical layers. The base maps are printed out on A3 size paper. Draft Version of Historical Maps Researchers use cross-hatch patterns and different colored pens to compile space-time-composite polygons directly on the base map. In some cases a section of the historical boundary line is judged to coincide with the 1911 or the 1990 boundary line, in other cases a new line is drawn directly on the base map to indicate the valid boundary for a particular period of time. The color coded patterns are dated and annotated alongside the sketch, directly on the base map. Each county or prefecture area is traced backwards in time using this method. Historical Point Locations Historical towns and administrative seats are determined using a similar method as the historical areas, sometimes on the same base map sheet as the areas, sometimes on a separate sheet. For historical points, the place names and their valid dates are written directly onto the base map. For each location, such as an administrative seat for a prefecture, the base map is examined to see if the correct location is now occupied by a contemporary point feature in the DMDC layer (circa 1990).  If the historical point is located exactly at the same position as the DMDC feature, the DMDC point is marked with a colored pen and labeled with the historical name and dates of validity.  If a matching position in DMDC is not available, the historical location is estimated based on the relative context of the DMDC points, boundaries, rivers and contemporary boundaries.  When establishing the location of historical points that cannot be "snapped" directly to existing DMDC features, many historical sources including maps, gazetteers, and secondary sources are consulted. Having established the best estimate for the location of a particular historical point, the point is added with a colored pen and labeled with the historical point's name and dates. The resulting base map contains a number of colored points with labels indicating the placename and the begin and end dates for which that name and location were valid. Compilation of the 1911 County Boundaries One of the GIS layers used for the base maps contains 1911 county boundary lines.  The method of compiling the 1911 county boundaries is both complex and illustrative of how the historical areas of jurisdiction are determined. The basic idea involves the addition of points to the CHGIS datasets, based on their existence in a particular county level jurisdiction in 1911. By judging which historical jurisdiction those points lie within, an approximate boundary line including those points can be drawn. The original maps produced in 1911 were not drawn to exact scale or known projection, but were created using a surveying and calculation technique which varied from region to region. Because of the scale and projection anomalies it is not possible to use the "rubber-sheeting" method to digitize the maps into GIS. Rubber-sheeting is the process of stretching and skewing a scanned digital image of a map so that a sampling of particular locations on the map match their correct positions in a known projection.  Rather than scanning and rubber-sheeting the 1911 maps, the original maps, are consulted alongside the GIS workstation. For sections of the 1911 boundary which are determined to be the same as 1990 boundary lines, those line sections are digitized by copying the existing arc segment to a new GIS layer. Similarly some of the historical boundary sections can be matched to sections of rivers, and these river arc segments are copied to the new layer. For parts of the border which do not correspond directly to the 1990 boundaries or the river lines, the points shown as lying within the jurisdiction of the 1911 county are carefully noted and compared with contemporary points. Many of these points can be snapped to their contemporary 1990 positions. Once the points known to have been part of the 1911 county have been digitized into the GIS layers, the remaining boundary sections encompassing those points can be drawn. The finished 1911 county boundary line will therefore include information derived in at least three ways: from line sections that exactly match 1990 county boundary line sections; from line sections that exactly match river line sections; from newly drawn line sections that contain known constituent towns for the year 1911.</procdesc>        <srcused>DMDC</srcused>        <srcused>Historical Atlas of China</srcused>        <procdate>Unknown</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>CHGIS, Harvard Yenching Institute</cntorg>              <cntper>Merrick Berman</cntper>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Project Manager</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>              <address>Vanserg Hall 20</address>              <address>25 Francis Ave</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-384-7380</cntvoice>            <cntemail>mberman@fas.harvard.edu</cntemail>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The CHGIS shapefile was imported to an ArcSDE Layer.</procdesc>        <srcused>CHGIS Version 1.0 Dataset</srcused>        <procdate>20030801</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library Team</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office For Information Systems</address>              <address>1280 Massachusetts Avenue</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday through Friday 9:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.
