There are two layers, one which contains the county seat (points) and the other county boundaries (polygons) that were within the jurisdiction of Songjiang, from it's founding in the 8th Century CE until 1911 CE. These layers are from the CHGIS Version 2 Time Series dataset. Time Series Data refers to GIS layers that contain many instances of spatial objects as they changed over time. Therefore, when spatial changes occurred to an object, both the previous and subsequent objects are included. Visually, this results in many overlapping objects, or "spaghetti," as it is referred to in GIS terms. For example, looking at two adjacent prefecture boundaries, let us presume that from Time 1 to Time 2 a certain boundary was valid. But at Time 3 a boundary change occurred. Because the boundary is shared by both the adjacent areas, it means that new objects are created for both areas. Therefore, instead of two objects we would have four objects. The changed portion of the boundary would show up as a distinct line, while the unchanged portion of the boundary would overlap the previous version.When dealing with Time Series Data it is necessary to keep in mind the visual ambiguity of the temporally distinct spatial objects, or "historical instances," which are all stored in a single GIS layer. It is necessary to do a selection of the objects by a particular year, in order to see the equivalent of a Time Slice.Time Slice Data refers to GIS layers that contain spatial objects representing a single year, or "slice in time." All of the 1820 and 1911 layers fall into this category.  When working with time slice data, all of the spatial objects are represented as the documentation indicates they existed for a particular year. Therefore two adjacent areas, such as two prefectures, would share a boundary, and by means of visual exploration of the data it is easy to distinguish one from the other.For more information on Time Slice and Time Series data, please access the "HOW TO" link at the following CHGIS website:http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/data/chgis/downloads/v2/The CHGIS will establish a database of historical administrative units for different periods in Chinese History, and will also provide a base GIS platform for researchers to use for spatial analysis, temporal statistical modeling, and representation of selected historical units as digital maps.</abstract>      <purpose>Developed by Fudan University, Center for Historical Geography, for the CHGIS project.The CHGIS project is designed to provide a GIS platform for scholarly and scientific research. Considerable flexibility has been designed into the GIS, allowing for alternate versions and variations of feature attributes, spatial data, and competing political entities. The CHGIS aims to build a reliable database of administrative units, but does not wish to impose a closed interpretation on the relationships among those units. The advantage of creating the CHGIS, rather than printing paper maps, is that the relationships between the units can be modified and improved whenever new information becomes available and the new "edition" needs only to be posted on the Internet for users to download. The CHGIS editors have set high editorial standards for the inclusion of material in the CHGIS data products and regulate the release of the official versions from designated CHGIS participating organizations.Users may search the database for settlements, administrative units and capitals, can create customized digital maps for particular times and places, or can join their own datasets for spatial anaysis, thematic mapping, or other specialized statistical modeling according to their own interests.</purpose>      <supplinf>The names of populated places in the CHGIS dataset are represented by both Chinese characters and Pinyin.  Chinese characters may not display properly on machines without the proper character sets installed. UTF-8 Encoding is employed for Chinese characters.Feature Types are used to classify the geographic features listed in the database. Since CHGIS is primarily concerned with developing a base GIS of administrative units and their changes throughout Chinese history, the feature types found in the current datasets are all historical administrative units, such as: commandery (jun), prefecture (zhou), prefecture (fu), county (xian), post road station (yi), and so forth. The feature types used so far are a sub-set of a much more extensive feature classification list, which has already been cross-indexed with the standard cartographic classification systems of China, Taiwan, and Japan.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <rngdates>          <begdate>746</begdate>          <enddate>1990</enddate>        </rngdates>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Revised (August 2003)</progress>      <update>As needed</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>120.890351</westbc>        <eastbc>121.842222</eastbc>        <northbc>31.627645</northbc>        <southbc>30.729550</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>location</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Cities</themekey>        <themekey>Towns</themekey>        <themekey>Place names</themekey>        <themekey>Administrative divisions</themekey>        <themekey>County government</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>None</themekt>        <themekey>County Capitals</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNIS</placekt>        <placekey>China</placekey>        <placekey>Shanghai</placekey>      </place>      <place>        <placekt>Dictionary of Chinese History</placekt>        <placekey>Songjiang</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>The CHGIS datasets are freely distributed for non-commercial academic research purposes.
