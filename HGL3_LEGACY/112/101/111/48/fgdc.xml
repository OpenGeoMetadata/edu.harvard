Walling; field work under the direction of L.H. Eaton. It was published by Lee &amp; Marsh in 1859, Scale 1:80,000. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images, representing the southwest portion of the four sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD1983). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, public buildings, schools, churches, cemeteries, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), private buildings with names of property owners, town boundaries, and more. Relief shown by hachures. It includes many cadastral insets of individual county towns and villages. It also includes illustrations, business directories, and tables of statistics and distances.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract><purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose><supplinf>Please note: Due to a lack of cartographic data sheets 1 and 4 of the 4 sheet source map were not georeferenced.  Please see 'cross references' for more information about the other sheets in this source map. Individual sheet images for this set not found in the Harvard Geospatial Library may be requested from the Harvard Map Collection (e-mail: maps@harvard.edu)</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1859</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>source map publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-69.517766</westbc><eastbc>-68.327842</eastbc><northbc>45.171563</northbc><southbc>44.541609</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>LCSH</themekt><themekey>Maps</themekey><themekey>Human settlements</themekey><themekey>Cities and towns</themekey><themekey>Villages</themekey><themekey>Landforms</themekey><themekey>Bodies of water</themekey><themekey>Land use</themekey><themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey><themekey>Transportation</themekey><themekey>Real property</themekey><themekey>Landowners</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey></theme><place><placekt>GNIS</placekt><placekey>Maine</placekey><placekey>Penobscot County</placekey><placekey>Alton</placekey><placekey>Argyle</placekey><placekey>Bangor</placekey><placekey>Bradford</placekey><placekey>Bradley</placekey><placekey>Brewer</placekey><placekey>Carmel</placekey><placekey>Charleston</placekey><placekey>Clifton</placekey><placekey>Corinna</placekey><placekey>Corinth</placekey><placekey>Dexter</placekey><placekey>Dixmont</placekey><placekey>Eddington</placekey><placekey>Etna</placekey><placekey>Exeter</placekey><placekey>Garland</placekey><placekey>Glenburn</placekey><placekey>Greenbush</placekey><placekey>Greenfield</placekey><placekey>Hampden</placekey><placekey>Hermon</placekey><placekey>Holden</placekey><placekey>Hudson</placekey><placekey>Kenduskeag</placekey><placekey>Lagrange</placekey><placekey>Levant</placekey><placekey>Milford</placekey><placekey>Newburgh</placekey><placekey>Newport</placekey><placekey>Old Town</placekey><placekey>Orono</placekey><placekey>Orrington</placekey><placekey>Plymouth</placekey><placekey>Stetson</placekey><placekey>Summit</placekey><placekey>Veazie</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard Map Collection</address><address>Pusey Library</address><address>Harvard University</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></ptcontac><native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3</native><crossref><citeinfo><origin>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</origin><origin>Walling, Henry Francis, 1825-1888.</origin><origin>Lee &amp; Marsh.</origin><origin>H.F.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 304.75533 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Walling, Henry Francis, 1825-1888.</origin><origin>Lee &amp; Marsh.</origin><origin>H.F.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were processed Adobe Photoshop. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc><srcused>Paper Map</srcused><procdate>2009</procdate><srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>D-Level, Room D-30</address><address>Widener Library</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefile was used as a base map for reference: Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) hyd24 (hydrography) 2004, (1:24,000) and Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems (MEGIS) metwp24 (towns) 2004, (1:24,000). The vector data is projected in the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD1983), and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.A world file (.tfw) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image. Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc><srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused><procdate>2009</procdate><srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard University Library</address><address>Office for Information Systems</address><address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct><rastinfo><rasttype>Pixel</rasttype><rowcount>9507</rowcount><colcount>12799</colcount><vrtcount>1</vrtcount></rastinfo></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>19</utmzone><transmer><sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer><longcm>-69.000000</longcm><latprjo>0.000000</latprjo><feast>500000.000000</feast><fnorth>0.000000</fnorth></transmer></utm></gridsys><planci><plance>row and column</plance><coordrep><absres>7.305772</absres><ordres>7.338087</ordres></coordrep><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn><ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
