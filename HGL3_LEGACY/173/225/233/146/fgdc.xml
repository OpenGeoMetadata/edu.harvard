Depending on the year, existing 1st level divisions may include: Roman or civil dioceses, the Ottoman eyalets, the autonomous communities of Spain or the regions of France and Italy. Some states are composed of divisions of their own. For instance, the United Kingdom is divided into England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Austria-Hungary is divided into Austrian Lands and Hungary while Bosnia was under common administration. For consistency reasons, these situations have been treated as if the state was divided in 1st level administrative divisions. This layer is part of the Euratlas Georeferenced Vector Data collection that is composed of 21 maps, one for each century from year 1 to year 2000. These maps depict the detailed political situation of Europe at the first day of each centennial year C.E. from year 1 to 2000. Each map is composed of two kinds of layers: physical features layers, such as seas and rivers, and political features layers, such as states and cities. Some layers also cover adjacent portions of North Africa and the Middle East.</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1500</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-17.803115</westbc>        <eastbc>41.034300</eastbc>        <northbc>47.247770</northbc>        <southbc>27.755006</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Boundaries</themekey>        <themekey>Administrative and political divisions</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>boundaries</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>LCSH</placekt>        <placekey>Europe</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>Access is granted to Harvard University Affiliates only.

Thus, it is important to know how this database is structured in order to be able to use the whole information [all the layers] contained in it. States and administrative divisions The states and administrative divisions form a hierarchy of territories which is completely defined from the 2nd-level administrative divisions. Thus, the territory of a sovereign state is defined as the union of all its owned 2nd level divisions. Similarly, a 1st level division is the union of all its composing 2nd level divisions. However, 1st level divisions are optional and thus, not all 2nd level divisions are part of a 1st level divisions. Thus, each 2nd level division has a reference on its owner sovereign state and on its potential parent 1st level division. Note also that 1st level divisions also have a reference on their owner state and this owner is the same than the one of their composing 2nd level divisions except in few cases with dependent states (explained below)  Dependent states Each 2nd level division may optionally have a reference on another state called its holder state. This happens in the case of dependent state (see political description). In such case, a 2nd level division has both a sovereign state (its owner) and a dependent state (its holder). Thus, this holder reference is used to generate the sovereign and dependent states layer. This layer has been built by grouping 2nd level divisions having the same owner state and the same holder state (if any). Thus, resulting features may be associated to two states, an owner (or sovereign) state and possibly, a holder (dependent) state. Also, on this layer, a state may appear as several features. For example, if a state owns a part without holder and another part with a holder, then it will appear as 2 features in this layer.Also, it is possible for a state to have both a sovereign (owned) part and a dependent (holded) part. In very few cases, it happens that a 2nd level division and its parent 1st level division are not owned by the same state. In such cases, the owner of the 1st level division is actually the holder of the 2nd level division. For this reason, 2nd level divisions have another optional reference to those so-called holder 1st level division. Note however that only one 1st level parent will be defined for a 2nd level division, either for its owner state, or for its holder state. Supranational entities Supranational entities are also defined in a similar way from the 2nd level divisions, which also contains an optional reference to a supranational entity. Although it would seem more natural to have supranational entities defined as unions of states, it is not so because it may happen, in the case of the Holy Roman Empire, that only parts of states belong to a supranational entity. Independent layers Autonomous peoples are not related to this hierarchy. They form an independent layer. Uncertain borders are a set of polygons covering some borders with a high level of uncertainty due to lack of information. However, they also are an independent layer and thus are not directly linked to any political entity. Moreover, it may happen that an uncertain border polygon covers more than just two political territories. Cities are also independent. They are defined in a year-independent manner by a unique point location. Each city has also name and size information for every century for which the city exists. Political entities IDs States, supranational entities, autonomous peoples and cities are all identified by a unique integer ID (generally owner_id or entity_id). These IDs are unique between political territories. This means that a state cannot have the same ID than an autonomous people or a supranational entity in the same year. Cities form a separated set of IDs which overlaps with those of the political territories. Finally, all these IDs are consistent throughout the years. Thus, a state which is present on several years, like Roman Empire, will have the same ID in every year. The same is also true for cities. Moreover, some states are present as autonomous people in a year and as state, with the same ID, in another year. 1st and 2nd level administrative divisions are defined on a year-dependent manner. Thus, it is not possible to make any correspondence between administrative divisions of one year with the ones of another year.</eaover>      <eadetcit>Euratlas. (2010).
