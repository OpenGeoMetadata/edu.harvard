The first digit of a five-digit ZIP Code divides the country into 10 large groups of states numbered from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in the far West. Within these areas, each state is divided into an average of 10 smaller geographical areas, identified by the 2nd and 3rd digits. These digits, in conjunction with the first digit, represent a sectional center facility or a mail processing facility area. These areas are serviced by the U.S. Post Office Sectional Center Facility (SCF). Note that a single SCF often services multiple three-digit areas.</abstract>      <purpose>U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Three-Digit) provides area and population for each three-digit ZIP Code area in the United States.</purpose>      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <mdattim>          <sngdate>            <caldate>200311</caldate>          </sngdate>          <sngdate>            <caldate>2000</caldate>          </sngdate>          <sngdate>            <caldate>200303</caldate>          </sngdate>        </mdattim>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition: 200311, 2000; publication date: 200303</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>Matches software update releases</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-178.226727</westbc>        <eastbc>-66.952936</eastbc>        <northbc>71.357355</northbc>        <southbc>18.916073</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Zip codes</themekey>        <themekey>Postal service</themekey>        <themekey>Population Statistics</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>location</themekey>        <themekey>society</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>None</themekt>        <themekey>polygon</themekey>        <themekey>zip codes</themekey>        <themekey>areas</themekey>        <themekey>three-digit zip codes</themekey>        <themekey>sectional center facility</themekey>        <themekey>population</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>LCSH</placekt>        <placekey>United States</placekey>      </place>      <temporal>        <tempkt>None</tempkt>        <tempkey>2003</tempkey>        <tempkey>2000</tempkey>        <tempkey>2003</tempkey>      </temporal>    </keywords>    <accconst>Access granted to Licensee only.</accconst>    <useconst>The data are provided under the Harvard University Site License.

The U.S. Post Office assigns ZIP Codes on a street-by-street basis. ZIP code areas are used by the USPS to deliver mail more effectively. Their purpose was never intended to form boundaries for spatial analysis. As a result, GDT formed the following processes to build boundaries from the mail stops present on street segments. By utilizing a wide variety of sources, GDT is able to locate ZIP code changes both large and small and change the representation of ZIP Code areas by redefining the boundaries.Aligning ZIP Code Zones &amp; Street Segments: The ZIP boundaries are created manually by following actual Dynamap street segments and other non-street features. In areas where the street name match rate is low, GDT technicians make telephone inquiries to area Post Offices, and refer to USPS ZIP+4 State Directories, to determine the predominant ZIP Code. The ZIP Code delivery "zone" is approximated, and ZIP boundaries are created manually by following Dynamap street and non-street segments.U.S. ZIP Code Areas have been generalized to 1,000 points per polygon and 4,000 points per feature.</procdesc>        <procdate>200401</procdate>        <srcprod>GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 14.0</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Copied 2004 U.S. ZIP Code Areas and renamed it. Added ZIP3 attribute and summarized on the first 3 characters in the ZIP Code. Summarized AREA, SUMBLKPOP, and POP2003 attributes. Removed -99 values when summarizing POP2003 attribute. Manually fixed 7 features when ZIP Code is in more than one state (given to the largest area state). Corrected 000 and 001 features to be individual features for easier display. Converted the data set to SDC. Created the projection file (.prj) and spatial indices.</procdesc>        <srcused>GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 14.0</srcused>        <srcused>Census 94-171</srcused>        <srcused>ESRI BIS</srcused>        <procdate>20040315</procdate>        <srcprod>SDC</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>ESRI</cntorg>              <cntper>Data Team</cntper>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>380 New York Street</address>              <city>Redlands</city>              <state>California</state>              <postal>92373-8100</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>909-793-2853</cntvoice>            <cntfax>909-793-5953</cntfax>            <cntemail>info@esri.com</cntemail>            <hours>8:00 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Pacific time, Monday-Friday</hours>            <cntinst>In the United States:Please direct all inquiries regarding software/data pricing and consulting services to your local ESRI Regional Office.

The file was stored in SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.  ArcCatalog 9.1was utilized to export the SDC file to a shapefile and then loaded into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the command line importing tool "SHP2SDE".   Any shapes that were rejected due to bad geometry were fixed with the "Repair Geometry" tool in ArcCatalog.  These shapes were then appended to the ArcSDE layer using the SDE command line tool "SHP2SDE append".</procdesc>        <srcused>SDC</srcused>        <procdate>20060314</procdate>        <srcprod>Shape</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>1280 Massachusetts Avenue</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Vector</direct>    <ptvctinf>      <sdtsterm>        <sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype>        <ptvctcnt>3289</ptvctcnt>      </sdtsterm>    </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <geograph>        <latres>0.000001</latres>        <longres>0.000001</longres>        <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>      </geograph>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>        <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257222</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <detailed>      <enttyp>        <enttypl>ESRI04USZIP3</enttypl>        <enttypd>The polygons represent areas serviced by sectional center facilities or mail processing facilities within United States.</enttypd>        <enttypds>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</enttypds>      </enttyp>      <attr>        <attrlabl>POP2003</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The 2003 estimated population of the ZIP Code area.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>ESRI Business Information Solutions</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Populations for the features.</udom>        </attrdomv>        <attrdomv>          <edom>            <edomv>-99</edomv>            <edomvd>Data not available.</edomvd>            <edomvds>ESRI</edomvds>          </edom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>ZIP3</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The three-digit number used by the postal service to identify an area serviced by a sectional center facility or mail processing facility.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>United States Postal Service</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <codesetd>            <codesetn>USPS National 5-Digit ZIP and Post Office Directory</codesetn>            <codesets>United States Postal Service</codesets>          </codesetd>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>STATE</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The two-letter abbreviation for the state in which the ZIP Code area is located.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>United States Postal Service</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <codesetd>            <codesetn>USPS City/State File</codesetn>            <codesets>United States Postal Service</codesets>          </codesetd>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>ESRI04USZIP3.AREA</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The area of the ZIP Code polygon in square miles using Albers Equal Area Projection.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Calculated areas for the features.</udom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>ESRI04USZIP3.FID</attrlabl>        <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>SHAPE</attrlabl>        <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>SUMBLKPOP</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The sum of the 2000 population for the Census Bureau Block polygon centroids which fall within the zip code area.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>ESRI;
