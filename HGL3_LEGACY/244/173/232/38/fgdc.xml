Statistical measures included in this datalayer are:  single or dual head-of-household, size and age of family, sub-family characteristics and many more. Please see "Supplemental Information" below for more information on the Census terms and definitions used in this datalayer.This file is an extract of data from the 1990 U.S. Census of Population and Housing STF 3A and was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001.The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <supplinf>The following information pertains to the terms used by the U.S. Census Bureau to define those categories of the population included in this layer. Parts of the following were transcribed from the glossary available through the U.S. Census Fact Finder website at: http://factfinder.census.govHousehold Type and Relationship Definition:    Household: A household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements. Persons Per Household: A measure obtained by dividing the number of persons in households by the number of households (or householders). In cases where persons in households are cross-classified by race or Hispanic origin, persons in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual. Relationship to Householder Householder: The data on relationship to householder were derived from answers to questionnaire item 2, which was asked of all persons in housing units. One person in each household is designated as the householder. In most cases, this is the person, or one of the persons, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented and who is listed in column 1 of the census questionnaire. If there is no such person in the household, any adult household member 15 years old and over could be designated as the householder. Households are classified by type according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family householder and a non-family householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or more persons related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all persons in the household related to him or her are family members. A non-family householder is a householder living alone or with non-relatives only.  This datalayer contains data on family households onlySpouse: Includes a person married to and living with a householder. This category includes persons in formal marriages, as well as persons in common-law marriages. The number of spouses is equal to the number of "married-couple families" or "married-couple households" in 100-percent tabulations. The number of spouses, however, is generally less than half of the number of "married persons with spouse present" in sample tabulations, since more than one married couple can live in a household, but only spouses of householders are specifically identified as "spouse." For sample tabulations, the number of "married persons with spouse present" includes married-couple subfamilies and married-couple families. Child: Includes a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or adopted child of the householder, regardless of the child's age or marital status. The category excludes sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and foster children. Own Child: A never-married child under 18 years who is a son or daughter by birth, a stepchild, or an adopted child of the householder. In certain tabulations, own children are further classified as living with two parents or with one parent only. Own children of the householder living with two parents are by definition found only in married-couple families. In a subfamily, an "own child" is a never-married child under 18 years of age who is a son, daughter, stepchild, or an adopted child of a mother in a mother-child subfamily, a father in a father-child subfamily, or either spouse in a married-couple subfamily. Family Type: A family consists of a householder and one or more other persons living in the same household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All persons in a household who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household may comprise a group of unrelated persons or one person living alone. Families are classified by type as either a "married-couple family" or "other family" according to the sex of the householder and the presence of relatives. The data on family type are based on answers to questions on sex and relationship which were asked on a 100-percent basis. Married-Couple Family:A family in which the householder and his or her spouse are enumerated as members of the same household. Other Family: Male Householder, No Wife Present: A family with a male householder and no spouse of householder present. Female Householder, No Husband Present: A family with a female householder and no spouse of householder present. Subfamily:A subfamily is a married couple (husband and wife enumerated as members of the same household) with or without never-married children under 18 years old, or one parent with one or more never-married children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to, but not including, either the householder or the householder's spouse. The number of subfamilies is not included in the count of families, since subfamily members are counted as part of the householder's family. Subfamilies are defined during processing of sample data. In selected tabulations, subfamilies are further classified by type: married-couple subfamilies, with or without own children; mother-child subfamilies; and father-child</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>19904001</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-73.508240</westbc>        <eastbc>-69.927802</eastbc>        <northbc>42.886818</northbc>        <southbc>41.237962</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>boundaries</themekey>        <themekey>society</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Demography</themekey>        <themekey>Population geography</themekey>        <themekey>Census</themekey>        <themekey>Households</themekey>        <themekey>Family</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</placekt>        <placekey>Massachusetts</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.

Its files and maps are designed to show only the relative positions of elements. Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places.  The positional accuracy of these coordinates may not be as great as the six decimal places suggest and the positional accuracy varies with the source materials used.Despite the fact that MEA data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. This precision allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs</origin>            <title>MassGIS Town Boundaries</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>online</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>1999</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>MassGIS</srccitea>        <srccontr>Town boundaries derived from MassGIS Town boundaries (with coastline) dataset</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</origin>            <title>1990 Census of Population and Housing Summary Tape File (STF-3)</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>19900401</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Summary Tape File 3 (STF3)</srccitea>        <srccontr>Tabular data for population statistics derived from this source.</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>See Citation information for this datalayer</origin>            <pubdate>200107</pubdate>            <title>Massachusetts Electronic Atlas</title>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>computer program</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200107</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>MEA Database</srccitea>        <srccontr>Town boundary data and Attribute tabular data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Tabular data compiled and edited from US Census Bureau STF-3; Town boundary data derived from MassGIS database.
