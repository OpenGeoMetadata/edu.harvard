A Core-Based Statistical Area consists of a county containing an Incorporated Place or Census Designated Place with a population of at least 10,000 along with any adjacent counties that have at least 25 percent of employed residents of the county who work in the CBSA's core or central county. CBSAs are categorized as being either Metropolitan or Micropolitan. Each Metropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. Each Micropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population.</abstract>      <purpose>U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas provides the names and types of core-based statistical areas.</purpose>      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>200401</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>Matches software update releases</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-160.554891</westbc>        <eastbc>-65.589828</eastbc>        <northbc>65.454473</northbc>        <southbc>17.881246</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Metropolitan areas</themekey>        <themekey>Census</themekey>        <themekey>Census districts</themekey>        <themekey>Boundaries</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>economy</themekey>        <themekey>society</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>None</themekt>        <themekey>polygon</themekey>        <themekey>core based statistical areas</themekey>        <themekey>cbsa</themekey>        <themekey>cities</themekey>        <themekey>metropolitan statistical areas</themekey>        <themekey>micropolitan statistical areas</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>LCSH</placekt>        <placekey>United States</placekey>      </place>      <temporal>        <tempkt>None</tempkt>        <tempkey>2004</tempkey>      </temporal>    </keywords>    <accconst>Access granted to Licensee only.</accconst>    <useconst>The data are provided under the Harvard University Site License.

The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</origin>            <pubdate>200401</pubdate>            <title>Dynamap/CBSA Core Based Statistical Areas v. 1.0</title>            <edition>Version 1.0</edition>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Dynamap/CBSA Core Based Statistical Areas</sername>              <issue>Version 1.0</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA</pubplace>              <publish>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</publish>            </pubinfo>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>100000</srcscale>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200401</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>GDT Dynamap/CBSA</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>CBSA polygons are built from GDT County boundaries.
