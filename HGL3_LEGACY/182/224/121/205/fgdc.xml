The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files, then generalized to 1:5,000,000-scale.  Generalizing reduced the positional accuracy to (+/- 8350 feet approximately).  This is based on the  positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates before being generalized which varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, Geography Division</origin>            <pubdate>200002</pubdate>            <title>106th Congressional Districts, Jan. 1999-Jan. 2001 Cartographic Boundary Files</title>            <edition>106th Congressional Districts</edition>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Congressional Districts</sername>              <issue>106th Congressional Districts</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>online</pubplace>              <publish>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, Geography Division</publish>            </pubinfo>            <onlink>http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/cd106.html</onlink>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>5000000</srcscale>        <typesrc>online</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <rngdates>              <begdate>199901</begdate>              <enddate>200101</enddate>            </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Census Geo.</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Geography extracted from the Census Bureau's TIGER database.
