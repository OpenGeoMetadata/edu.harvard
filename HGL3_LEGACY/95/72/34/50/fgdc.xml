Merged the block points into a national shapefile.  Checked that all the block points reside within the correct block group polygons using a spatial overlay.  As a result: 1) corrected latitude and longitude coordinate errors for features in Alaska, and 2) moved block points that were in the incorrect block group and updated the latitude and longitude values of the block points.  Attached the U.S. Census SF1 attributes POP2000, HSE_UNITS, and HOUSEHOLDS.  Added attributes STATE_FIPS, CNTY_FIPS, STCOFIPS, TRACT, and BLOCK and created their values from parsing the values of the FIPS attribute.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>        <srcused>Dynamap/Census Boundaries v. 6.0</srcused>        <srcused>Census SF1</srcused>        <procdate>20060413</procdate>        <srcprod>SDC</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>ESRI</cntorg>              <cntper>Data Team</cntper>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>380 New York Street</address>              <city>Redlands</city>              <state>California</state>              <postal>92373-8100</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>909-793-2853</cntvoice>            <cntfax>909-793-5953</cntfax>            <cntemail>info@esri.com</cntemail>            <hours>8:00 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Pacific time, Monday-Friday</hours>            <cntinst>In the United States-Please direct all inquiries regarding software/data pricing and consulting services to your local ESRI Regional Office.

In order to create state-wide subsets of the large national-coverage dataset, the original layer was exported from SDC to Shapefile format and then divided by state by running a script based on the State FIPS code in the attribute table.  Each state layer was then exported into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the Feature Class to Feature Class tool in ArcCatalog 9.2.</procdesc>        <srcused>SDC</srcused>        <procdate>200707</procdate>        <srcprod>Shape</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Vector</direct>    <ptvctinf>      <sdtsterm>        <sdtstype>Entity point</sdtstype>        <ptvctcnt>141320</ptvctcnt>      </sdtsterm>    </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <geograph>        <latres>0.000001</latres>        <longres>0.000001</longres>        <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>      </geograph>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>        <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257222</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <detailed>      <enttyp>        <enttypl>ESRI06USBLKPOP_NJ</enttypl>        <enttypd>The points represent the centroids of census blocks, the smallest entity for which the Census Bureau collects and tabulates decennial census information within United States; bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, and county limits.</enttypd>        <enttypds>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</enttypds>      </enttyp>      <attr>        <attrlabl>OBJECTID</attrlabl>        <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>STATE_FIPS</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The FIPS code (two-digit number) for the state in which the block is located.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <codesetd>            <codesetn>Federal Information Processing Standards</codesetn>            <codesets>National Institute of Standards and Technology</codesets>          </codesetd>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>CNTY_FIPS</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The FIPS code (three-digit number) for the county in which the block is located.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <codesetd>            <codesetn>Federal Information Processing Standards</codesetn>            <codesets>National Institute of Standards and Technology</codesets>          </codesetd>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>STCOFIPS</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The combined state and county FIPS code.
