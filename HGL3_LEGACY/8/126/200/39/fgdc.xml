It was published by Maison Andriveau-Goujon, Henry Barrere Editeur in 1908. Scale 1:1,000,000. Covers Morocco and portions of Algeria. Map in French.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to a modified 'Europe Lambert Conformal Conic' projection with a central meridian of 7 degrees West. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, roads, ruins, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by landforms and spot heights. Includes indexs and insets: Mazagan (Scale 1:20,000) -- Casa Blanca (Scale 1:20,000) -- Tanger (Scale 1:20,000) -- Safi (Scale 1:20,000) -- Larache (Scale 1:20,000) -- El-Qsar el-Kebir (Scale 1:20,000) -- Rabat (Scale 1:50,000) -- Taroudant (Scale 1:40,000) -- Mogador (Scale 1:20,000) -- Agadir Irir (Scale 1:20,000) -- Oujda (Scale 1:20,000) -- El-Aioun Si Mellouk (Scale 1:10,000) -- Meknes (Scale 1:50,000) -- Fes (Scale 1:30,000) -- Figuig (Scale 1:200,000) -- Marrakech (Scale 1:60,000) -- Environs de Fes (Scale 1:100,000). This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Islamic Heritage Project. Maps selected for the project represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes. The Islamic Heritage Project consists of over 100,000 digitized pages from Harvard's collections of Islamic manuscripts and published materials. Supported by Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and developed in association with the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard University.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1908</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-13.287639</westbc>        <eastbc>2.106850</eastbc>        <northbc>36.627091</northbc>        <southbc>27.105848</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Cities and towns</themekey>        <themekey>Landforms</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNS</placekt>        <placekey>Morocco</placekey>        <placekey>Algeria</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard Map Collection</address>          <address>Pusey Library</address>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>    </attracc>    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. For instance, this map contains grid-like seams that are the result of being formerly folded as a booklet. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 5123.00811 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Flotte de Roquevaire, R. de.</origin>            <origin>Barrere, Henry.</origin>            <pubdate>1908</pubdate>            <title>Maroc</title>            <geoform>map</geoform>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Paris</pubplace>              <publish>Maison Andriveau-Goujon, Henry Barrere Editeur</publish>            </pubinfo>            <othercit>1 map : col. ; 101 x 132 cm.</othercit>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>1000000</srcscale>        <typesrc>paper</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>1908</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Paper Map</srccitea>        <srccontr>Source map for raster image</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Better Light Super8K2 scanning back camera and Better Light ViewFinder capture software). Loose and bound maps for the OCP Islamic Heritage Project were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. For proofing purposes, original materials were evaluated using GTI EVS viewing booths. Images were evaluated using calibrated Eizo ColorEdge monitors. Tonal and color corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop (enhancements: Photoshop filters: unsharp mask; hue/saturation; selective color; levels; curves). Master Image files were corrected and archived in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2009</procdate>        <srcprod>JP2 Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used for reference:  the National Geophysical Data Center's "Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline Database, version 1.3" (1:100,000) (1996) and ESRI Data and Maps 2008: "World Cities" (1:15,000,000) and "World Gazetteer" (1:1,000,000). The vector data was projected to a modified 'Europe Lambert Conformal Conic' projection with a central meridian of 7 degrees West, and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.  A world file (.j2w) was automatically generated and saved in association with the image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the Root Mean Squared (RMS) error of this image.  Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>        <srcused>JP2 Map Image</srcused>        <procdate>2009</procdate>        <srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Raster</direct>    <rastinfo>      <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>      <rowcount>11795</rowcount>      <colcount>15783</colcount>      <vrtcount>1</vrtcount>    </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <mapproj>          <mapprojn>Lambert Conformal Conic</mapprojn>          <lambertc>            <stdparll>43.000000</stdparll>            <stdparll>62.000000</stdparll>            <longcm>-7.000000</longcm>            <latprjo>30.000000</latprjo>            <feast>0.000000</feast>            <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>          </lambertc>        </mapproj>        <planci>          <plance>row and column</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>89.618116</absres>            <ordres>89.942414</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>meters</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>D_European_1950</horizdn>        <ellips>International_1924</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378388.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>297.000000</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <overview>      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
