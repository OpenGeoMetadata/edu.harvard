Goad map set entitled: Insurance plan of Alexandria Egypt, Vol. 1, published June 1898. This image is of Plate 17 (Minet El Bassal). Scale 1:600. Covers the central part of Alexandria.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Egypt Red Belt projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. These large scale fire insurance maps typically include: building footprints, building construction material (frame, brick, plaster, stone), building heights, roof types, doors, windows, selected owner names, selected building functions, property boundaries, building street addresses, street names, railroads, fire hydrants, fire floats, fire brigades, cotton bales, and more. Building construction material is shown by colored shading. The index plate of the map set includes an explanation of map features. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic fire insurance and land ownership atlases and map sets of various regions from the Harvard Map Collection. The selection of scanned atlases and maps sets represent a range of originators and ground condition dates.</abstract><purpose>Fire insurance and land ownership atlases and maps sets published in the 19th and early 20th centuries are one of the most valuable sources for monitoring and viewing urban change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1905</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>source map publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>29.884847</westbc><eastbc>29.889416</eastbc><northbc>31.189443</northbc><southbc>31.184931</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>LCSH</themekt><themekey>Maps</themekey><themekey>Insurance, Fire</themekey><themekey>Real property</themekey><themekey>Landowners</themekey><themekey>Buildings</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey><themekey>structure</themekey><themekey>planningCadastre</themekey></theme><place><placekt>GNS</placekt><placekey>Egypt</placekey><placekey>Alexandria</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard Map Collection</address><address>Pusey Library</address><address>Harvard University</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></ptcontac><native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3.1</native><crossref><citeinfo><origin>Goad, Charles E.</origin><pubdate>1898-1910</pubdate><title>Insurance plan of Alexandria Egypt</title><geoform>map</geoform><pubinfo><pubplace>London</pubplace><publish>C.E.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process. For instance, this raster image was georeferenced to another georeferenced image, which has its own positional inaccuracies (see "Process Steps"). In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.The RMS error for this map is 1.84645 meters. This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Goad, Charles E.</origin><pubdate>1898-1910</pubdate><title>Insurance plan of Alexandria Egypt, Vol. 1.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment.</procdesc><srcused>Paper Map</srcused><procdate>2011</procdate><srcprod>JP2 Map Image</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>D-Level, Room D-30</address><address>Widener Library</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3.1 software, the digital JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points located on the scanned, georeferenced index map from Volume 1 of this map set: Insurance Plan of Alexandria Egypt [1898] published in London by C. E. Goad. The index map was projected in the "Egypt Red Belt" projected coordinate system, and this image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.
