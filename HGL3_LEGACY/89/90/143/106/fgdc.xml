Data from both sources was integrated into 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files, then generalized and vertically integrated with 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph Data-Boundaries, County Boundaries of the United States, and Hydrography Features of the United States.  The resulting Public Land Survey System DLG files were published on CD-ROM in 1995.  The DLG optional format files were then converted to ARC/INFO coverages, and the individual state files were paneled together into a national coverage.  Numeric DLG codes were translated into English, and only polygon features were included in the national coverage.</procdesc>        <procdate>1999</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView Shapefile version of the data, plss00p020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it.
