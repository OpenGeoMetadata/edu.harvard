The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition). To improve the accuracy, GDT ran a process against the entire nationwide database. The positional accuracy of this data set exceeds the positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates.  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Geographic Data Technology, Inc.</origin>            <pubdate>199901</pubdate>            <title>Dynamap/2000 v9.0</title>            <edition>Version 9.0</edition>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>            <serinfo>              <sername>Dynamap/2000(r)</sername>              <issue>v9.0</issue>            </serinfo>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA</pubplace>              <publish>Geographic Data Technology, Inc</publish>            </pubinfo>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>100000</srcscale>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>199901</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>GDT Dynamap/2000 v9.0</srccitea>        <srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>GDT maintains Highways data from its internal, master database that includes nationwide street and road network data and 1990 Census data. Technicians then begin a state-by-state editing process that includes (but is not limited to): Eliminating errant segments-Occasionally, we have discovered cases where the highway, as digitized, deviates considerably from the actual course. In these cases, GDT technicians digitize the correct segments and delete the erroneous ones.  Feature reclassification-Another drawback to TIGER-derived files was their feature classification codes (FCCs). These codes were an attempt to classify streets and roads based on maintenance, a procedure that varied dramatically in different geographic areas. To correct this problem and create a consistent nationwide highway system, GDT reclassified almost every street and road in the nation based on its use.  Highways names are applied according to a layered hierarchy. Where a highway segment has more than one name, the higher-level name will always be used, and always in this order: Interstates, then U.S. Highways, State Highways and Local Names.  The data GDT uses to define highways and ensure completeness is culled from the following sources: ? Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Lists all interstates. ? U.S. Numbered Highways. Published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officers. Lists all state and U.S. highways. ? State highway maps. Highway maps from state travel and tourism agencies and/or state departments of transportation.</procdesc>        <procdate>199901</procdate>        <srcprod>GDT Dynamap/2000 v9.0</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data sets from GDT Dynamap/2000 v9.0.
