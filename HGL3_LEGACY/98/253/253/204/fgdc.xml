Washington, DC 20590) data and the VOLPERAIL (John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Service Assessment Division, DTS-49, 55 Broadway Cambridge, MA 02142) data were combined using conflation algorithms in both TransCAD and ARC/INFO.  Manual adjustments were then made to the resulting spatial database. The Official Railway Guide provided by the Rail Industry and published by K-111 Directory Corp. New York, NY contributed railroad line identification ownership and track rights.  Data quality report:  A partial quality control evaluation of the accuracy of the attributes was performed on the database.  The likelihood of attribute errors is greater in the urban than in the rural areas. There are no attributes listed for sidings. The railroad ownership and trackage rights attributes are not complete. The database is interconnected and is a flowable network.  However, there are occasions where the connections between links are not exactly in the correct geographical location.  There should be no redundancy of lines or nodes in the database.  Initial Quality Control checks found no obvious under- or overshoots. The database, however, is geographically accurate, at the 1:100,000 scale. The ownership/trackage attributes were generated by conflating the Federal Railroad Administration's 1:2,000,000 and the 1:100,000 TIGER/Line databases to the enhanced 1:100,000 DLG database.</procdesc>        <procdate>1997</procdate>        <srcprod>BTS - NRN100</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data set from the National Rail Network 1:100,000.
