Genl. Halleck, U.S. Army, in their advance upon Corinth in May 1862, surveyed under the direction of Col. Geo. Thom, A.D.C. &amp; Chief of Topl. Engrs., Dept. of the Mississippi ; by Lieuts. Fred. Schraag and C.L. Spangenberg, Asst. Topl. Engrs. ; drawn by Lieut. Otto H. Matz, Asst. Topl. Engr.  It was printed by Lith. of J. Bien, 1862. Scale [1:31,680].  Covers Corinth, Mississippi region including portions of Alcorn County, Mississippi and McNairy County, Tennessee. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (WGS 1984 UTM Zone 16N). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as houses, names of residents, fences, roads, railroads, vegetation, fields, drainage, Union and Confederate entrenchments, and more. Relief shown by hachures.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of the Civil War from the Harvard Map Collection. Many items from this selection are from a collection of maps deposited by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States Commandery of the State of Massachusetts (MOLLUS) in the Harvard Map Collection in 1938. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features, in particular showing places of military importance.  The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1862</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-88.605929</westbc>        <eastbc>-88.354367</eastbc>        <northbc>35.082080</northbc>        <southbc>34.837507</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Civil War, 1861-1865</themekey>        <themekey>Fortification</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>        <themekey>Corinth, Battle of, Corinth, Miss., 1862</themekey>        <themekey>Landowners</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>        <themekey>intelligenceMilitary</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNIS</placekt>        <placekey>Mississippi</placekey>        <placekey>Alcorn County</placekey>        <placekey>Corinth</placekey>      </place>      <place>        <placekt>GNIS</placekt>        <placekey>Tennessee</placekey>        <placekey>McNairy County</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard Map Collection</address>          <address>Pusey Library</address>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.1.</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 143.43816 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Matz, Otto H., 1830-1919.</origin>            <origin>Bien, Julius, 1826-1909.</origin>            <pubdate>1862</pubdate>            <title>Map of the country between Monterey, Tenn. &amp; Corinth, Miss. : showing the lines of entrenchments made &amp; the routes followed by the U.S. forces under the command of Maj.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Subjective color and contrasting editing were made at the discretion of the photographer.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2004</procdate>        <srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common reference points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as base maps for reference:  U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, TIGER 2000 Tennessee Road Lines (1:100,000); U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, TIGER 2000 Tennessee River and Stream Lines (1:100,000); U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, TIGER 2000 Tennessee Railroad Lines (1:100,000);  U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, TIGER 2000 Mississippi Road Lines (1:100,000); U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, TIGER 95 : Census Hydrographic Features, 1995 - Mississippi (1:100,000); and U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, TIGER 2000 Mississippi Railroad Lines (1:100,000). The vector data was projected to Universal Transverse Mercator projection (WGS 1984 UTM Zone 16N), and the images were subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.  ArcMap 9.1 software was utilized for the georeferencing process, and a .tfw (world file) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image.  Please note that while the image is stored in UTM coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data.</procdesc>        <srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused>        <procdate>2005</procdate>        <srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Raster</direct>    <rastinfo>      <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>      <rowcount>9928</rowcount>      <colcount>7876</colcount>      <vrtcount>1</vrtcount>    </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <gridsys>          <gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn>          <utm>            <utmzone>16</utmzone>            <transmer>              <sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer>              <longcm>-87.000000</longcm>              <latprjo>0.000000</latprjo>              <feast>500000.000000</feast>              <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>            </transmer>          </utm>        </gridsys>        <planci>          <plance>row and column</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>2.866623</absres>            <ordres>2.699119</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>meters</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn>        <ellips>WGS_1984</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257224</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <overview>      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
