Stanley. It was published by Harper &amp; Brothers in 1885. Scale [ca. 1:3,000,000]. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the eastern portion of the map. Covers a portion of Central Africa. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Africa Lambert Conformal Conic projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract><purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1885</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>source map publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>20.451958</westbc><eastbc>36.821084</eastbc><northbc>10.809788</northbc><southbc>-13.889827</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>LCSH</themekt><themekey>Maps</themekey><themekey>Human settlements</themekey><themekey>Cities and towns</themekey><themekey>Villages</themekey><themekey>Landforms</themekey><themekey>Bodies of water</themekey><themekey>Land use</themekey><themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey><themekey>Transportation</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey></theme><place><placekt>GNS</placekt><placekey>Angola</placekey><placekey>Burundi</placekey><placekey>Central African Republic</placekey><placekey>Congo, Democratic Republic of the</placekey><placekey>Congo River</placekey><placekey>Ethiopia</placekey><placekey>Gabon</placekey><placekey>Kenya</placekey><placekey>Malawi</placekey><placekey>Mozambique</placekey><placekey>Rwanda</placekey><placekey>Sudan</placekey><placekey>Tanzania</placekey><placekey>Uganda</placekey><placekey>Zambia</placekey></place><place><placekt>LCSH</placekt><placekey>Africa, Central</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard Map Collection</address><address>Pusey Library</address><address>Harvard University</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></ptcontac><native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3</native><crossref><citeinfo><origin>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</origin><origin>Stanley, Henry M.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process. In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 18033.84187 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Stanley, Henry M.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment.</procdesc><srcused>Paper Map</srcused><procdate>2011</procdate><srcprod>JP2 Map Image</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>D-Level, Room D-30</address><address>Widener Library</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the digital JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles. For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as a base map for reference: ESRI Data and Maps 2010: World Water Bodies (1:250,000); and A Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoeline Database (National Geophysical Data Center, 1996) (1:100,000). The base map data is projected in the Africa Lambert Conformal Conic projected coordinate system, and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.A world file (.j2w) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image. Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc><srcused>JP2 Map Image</srcused><procdate>2011</procdate><srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard Library</address><address>Library Technology Services</address><address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct><rastinfo><rasttype>Pixel</rasttype><rowcount>11164</rowcount><colcount>6971</colcount><vrtcount>1</vrtcount></rastinfo></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><mapproj><mapprojn>Lambert Conformal Conic</mapprojn><lambertc><stdparll>20.000000</stdparll><stdparll>-23.000000</stdparll><longcm>25.000000</longcm><latprjo>0.000000</latprjo><feast>0.000000</feast><fnorth>0.000000</fnorth></lambertc></mapproj><planci><plance>row and column</plance><coordrep><absres>241.823133</absres><ordres>229.228850</ordres></coordrep><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn><ellips>WGS_1984</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis><denflat>298.257224</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
