The sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the early 1980's.  The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale and 1:2,000,000-scale Bureau of Land Management State base maps.  These data were published on CD-ROM in 1995. Using ARC/INFO software, the DLG optional format files were converted to ARC/INFO coverages using the DLGARC command.  Only linear federal land features and attribute information were extracted for inclusion. The individual State coverages were then merged together using the ARC/INFO command APPEND.  The resulting data set was ATLAS-FEDL (Federal Land Features of the U.S. (linear)).  Using ATLAS-FEDL the spatial and attribute data were updated using the Wild and Scenic Rivers web site. The spatial data was integrated with ATLAS-HY (Hydrography Features of the U.S.) and ATLAS-RD (Major roads and trails of the U.S.).</procdesc>        <procdate>1999</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView Shapefile version of the data, fedlanl020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it.
