We work closely with NANPA to keep these boundaries as accurate as possible.  There is really no source scale since the data is related to us as "a certain Rate Center is within a certain NPA area". The accuracy of the Rate Center and therefore the NPA boundaries is better defined by their position relative to other features. In other words, whether or not the boundary follows a street or a county boundary is the important factor.</procdesc>        <procdate>200007</procdate>        <srcprod>GDT Dynamap/Telecommunication Products 4.2</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted state data sets from GDT Dynamap/Telecommunication Products 4.2.
