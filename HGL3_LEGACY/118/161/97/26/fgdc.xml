Missigman. It was published by Seattle Pioneer Pocket Guide in 1913. Scale [ca. 1:35,700].The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Washington State Plane North Coordinate System HARN NAD83 (in Feet) (Fipszone 4601). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, docks, piers, city boundaries, and more. Includes inset: Rainer Beach.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project.  Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods.  These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1913</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-122.468298</westbc>        <eastbc>-122.246355</eastbc>        <northbc>47.701103</northbc>        <southbc>47.508440</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Cities and towns</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Landforms</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNS (NIMA)</placekt>        <placekey>Washington</placekey>        <placekey>Seattle</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard Map Collection</address>          <address>Pusey Library</address>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@gentoo.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 240.84975 feet.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Missigman, L.</origin>            <origin>Royer, Edgar.</origin>            <origin>Von Babo, Arthur</origin>            <origin>Seattle Pioneer Pocket Guide.</origin>            <pubdate>1913</pubdate>            <title>Map of Seattle : 1913</title>            <geoform>map</geoform>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Seattle, Wash.</pubplace>              <publish>Seattle Pioneer Pocket Guide</publish>            </pubinfo>            <othercit>1 map : front &amp; back, 56 x 43 cm.</othercit>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>35700</srcscale>        <typesrc>paper</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>1913</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Paper Map</srccitea>        <srccontr>Source map for raster image</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder 5.x capture software).  Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed using Adobe Photoshop.  Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2008</procdate>        <srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common reference points located on digital vector shapefiles.  Vector shapefiles were acquired from the King County GIS Center. For this image, the following King County GIS vector shapefile(s) were used as base maps for reference: King County Transportation Network (TNET) Streets, 2003.  The image was georeferenced to and stored in the NAD83 HARN State Plane Washington North (feet) coordinate system.  ArcMap 9.2 software was utilized for the georeferencing process, and a .tfwx (world file) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. Please note that while the image is stored in State Plane coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data.</procdesc>        <srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused>        <procdate>2008</procdate>        <srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@gentoo.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Raster</direct>    <rastinfo>      <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>      <rowcount>6784</rowcount>      <colcount>5260</colcount>      <vrtcount>1</vrtcount>    </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <mapproj>          <mapprojn>Lambert Conformal Conic</mapprojn>          <lambertc>            <stdparll>47.500000</stdparll>            <stdparll>48.733333</stdparll>            <longcm>-120.833333</longcm>            <latprjo>47.000000</latprjo>            <feast>1640416.666667</feast>            <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>          </lambertc>        </mapproj>        <planci>          <plance>row and column</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>10.150475</absres>            <ordres>10.205405</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>survey feet</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>D_North_American_1983_HARN</horizdn>        <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257222</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <overview>      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
