It was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database. Features in this layer have FACC (Feature and Attribute Coding Catalogue) Codes of AA010, defined as, "Mine: An excavation made in the earth for the purpose of extracting natural deposits," or AA052, "Oil/Gas Field : An area where oil and/or gas is pumped or otherwise removed from the ground," or BH050, "Fish Hatchery/Fish Farm/Marine Farm : An enclosure of water used for the breeding and/or rearing of fish," or BH155, "Salt Evaporator : Shallow pools, normally man-made, used for the natural evaporation of water for the collection of salt." The datalayer was derived from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA, now the Nation Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)) Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database (1997). The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas. The Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database represents the third edition of the Digital Chart of the World. The second edition was a limited release item published 1995 09. The product is dual named to show its lineage to the original DCW, published in 1992, while positioning the revised product within a broader emerging-family of VMap products. VMap Level 0 is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data stored on compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM). The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The database contains more than 1,900 megabytes of vector data and is organized into 10 thematic layers. The data includes major road and rail networks, major hydrologic drainage systems, major utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), all major airports, elevation contours (1000 foot(ft), with 500ft and 250ft supplemental contours), coastlines, international boundaries and populated places. The database can be accessed directly from the four optical CD-ROMs that store the database or can be transferred to a magnetic media.</abstract>      <purpose>This data is a general purpose natural resources extraction area and fishery industrial areas datalayer designed to support Geographic Information Systems applications. This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-economic and political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <supplinf>Portions of this metadata are taken directly from the American Geological Institute, Global GIS, Web pages: http://www.agiweb.org/pubs/globalgis/</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>199701</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>original publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>Unknown</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-131.269302</westbc>        <eastbc>162.092941</eastbc>        <northbc>63.690418</northbc>        <southbc>-48.041592</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Mines and mineral resources</themekey>        <themekey>Oils fields</themekey>        <themekey>Gas fields</themekey>        <themekey>Salt mines and mining</themekey>        <themekey>Fisheries</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey>        <themekey>farming</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>LCSH</placekt>        <placekey>Earth</placekey>        <placekey>Northern Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Southern Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Eastern Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Western Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Africa</placekey>        <placekey>Asia</placekey>        <placekey>Australia</placekey>        <placekey>Europe</placekey>        <placekey>North America</placekey>        <placekey>South America</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None.</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.

Source chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature attributes in the VMap-0 data quality coverage. The primary accuracy analysis was performed on one chart only in the prototyping phase of the DCW project. Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters. Detailed horzontal accuracy figures were developed by comparing the positions of well-defined points in the roads, railroads, utility lines, and drainage coverages against sources of higher accuracy, measuring the offsets, and expressing differences as a Circular Map Accuracy figure at a 90% confidence interval. This figure was independently verified by adding known production errors to source chart accuracies in a root sum square calculation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>      <vertacc>        <vertaccr>This figure represents overall accuracy. Source chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature attributes in the V-Map 0 data quality coverage. Vertical Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters. Vertical accuracy figures were developed by comparing elevation contour locations on 1:24,000 scale maps to elevation values at the same location within the digital database. Some manual interpolation was necessary to complete this test. The analysis results are expressed as linear error at a 90% confidence interval.</vertaccr>      </vertacc>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>United States.
