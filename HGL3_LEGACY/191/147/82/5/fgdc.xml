Eayrs, c.e. ; under the direction of J.P. Cotton, c.e. ; J. Bergner, del.  It was published ca. 1892 by Simon Hart. Scale [ca. 1:13,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, city ward boundaries, selected property boundaries, buildings, and names of property owners, and more.  Includes inset: Road map of island of Rhode Island and Conanicut Island, surveyed by C.E. Hammett, Jr. Scale [ca. 1:85,000]. Also includes index to points of interest (churches, schools, hotels, libraries, mills, etc.), tables of elevation and distances, and shows radial distances.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1892</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-71.370988</westbc>        <eastbc>-71.277659</eastbc>        <northbc>41.530441</northbc>        <southbc>41.442567</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>        <themekey>Administrative and political divisions</themekey>        <themekey>Real property</themekey>        <themekey>Landowners</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNIS</placekt>        <placekey>Rhode Island</placekey>        <placekey>Newport</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard Map Collection</address>          <address>Pusey Library</address>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>ESRI ArcCatalog 9.1.</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 83.334 feet.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Eayrs, N.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed using Adobe Photoshop. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2006</procdate>        <srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common reference points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as base maps for reference: Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) : ritown5k (1:5,000) (2001); and  Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) : e911rds04 (1:5,000) (2004). The vector data was projected to Rhode Island State Plane Zone 3800, feet, NAD83, and the images were subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.  ArcMap 9.1 software was utilized for the georeferencing process, and a .tfw (world file) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image.  Please note that while the image is stored in State Plane coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data.</procdesc>        <srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused>        <procdate>2006-2007</procdate>        <srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Raster</direct>    <rastinfo>      <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>      <rowcount>8865</rowcount>      <colcount>7140</colcount>      <vrtcount>1</vrtcount>    </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <gridsys>          <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System</gridsysn>          <spcs>            <spcszone>3800</spcszone>            <transmer>              <sfctrmer>0.999994</sfctrmer>              <longcm>-71.500000</longcm>              <latprjo>41.083333</latprjo>              <feast>328083.333333</feast>              <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>            </transmer>          </spcs>        </gridsys>        <planci>          <plance>row and column</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>3.572356</absres>            <ordres>3.606068</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>survey feet</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>        <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257222</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <overview>      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
