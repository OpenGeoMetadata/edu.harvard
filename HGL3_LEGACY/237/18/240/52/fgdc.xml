Each valve has an attribute indicating whether its location was moved to that of a photo location.  The accuracy of the other valve locations is unknown.  The intent, with respect to the accuracy of the water main locations, was only to ensure that if a main existed in a street right-of-way or between two valves, it appeared in the GIS data layer.  In cases where a main connects two valves whose position was mapped from the aerial photography in a straight line, the main may be within 2 ? feet of its actual location.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>SEA Consultants</origin>            <pubdate>Unknown</pubdate>            <title>Water System CAD Files</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>computer program</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>1991</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>SEA CAD</srccitea>        <srccontr>CAD files (one per map sheet) of the water system were converted from DXF format to Arc/Info format and merged into a single data layer.</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>James W.

Sewall Co. The aerial photographs were taken on April 15, 1994.  The photographs were produced at a scale of 1" = 600' at an approximate altitude above datum of 3,600 feet.The information below is from the James W. Sewall Co.

It was made into a separate layer for easy display using Arcview.There were two kinds of source materials.  The first was computer files in CAD format of the water system; SEA Consultants, Inc developed them in 1991.  The other source was point locations for valves and hydrants mapped photogrammetrically from the city's 1994 aerial photography by James.W. Sewall Co.  Before the photographs were taken, the valves and hydrants were identified with a painted target that would be visible on the photos when they were viewed through a stereoplotter.  A field check of the area on four non-contiguous 1" = 40' scale Assessor's map sheets showed that about 73% of the valves were mapped correctly.  This result was low for several reasons: the valve target was small, there were problems with shadows and cars hiding targeted and un-targeted valves, and it is easy to confuse Boston Gas Company valves with water valves.  In addition, valves are often paved over.  A field check of hydrant mapping results showed that for four 1" = 40' scale Assessor's maps, about 84% of the hydrants were correctly mapped. The 31 CAD files (one per map sheet) were converted from DXF format to Arc/Info format and merged into a single data layer.  Pipe features were checked to make sure they ran seamlessly across sheet boundaries.  Arc-node topology was created from the node and line symbol layers in the CAD files; valves and hydrants were represented as nodes in the arc-node topology.  Then valve and hydrant locations in the Arc/Info file were adjusted, when appropriate, to match the location of a point from the photography.  Features converted from the CAD files also include blow-offs and check valves.In 1998, because of requirements of hydrologic modeling software and the Hansen Infrastructure Management System database, the hydrants were converted from node features to point features. This was accomplished by using the Arc command nodepoint to create a point layer from the arc nodes in the water system data layer; these points were then edited so they contained only hydrants; they were then added back into the water system coverage.  Subsequently, the hydrant nodes were removed from the water main network data layer and, at that time, hydrant feeder pipes were also removed from the water system pipe network.  Hydrant attributes originally included the same hydrant number that appeared in the Engineering Dept. version of the atlas.  However it turned out that these numbers were unique only within an atlas sheet.  Therefore, the hydrants were re-numbered with a unique sequential number.  The number from the atlas has been retained as the old hydrant number.</procdesc>        <procdate>1998?</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Newton GIS</cntorg>            </cntorgp>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The original shape file was imported to an ArcSDE Layer.</procdesc>        <procdate>200208</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library Team</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Office of Information Systems</address>              <address>1280 Massachusetts Avenue</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Metadata created, imported and edited</procdesc>        <procdate>20021007</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntperp>              <cntper>Geospatial Resources Cataloger</cntper>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntperp>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Vector</direct>    <ptvctinf>      <sdtsterm>        <sdtstype>Entity point</sdtstype>        <ptvctcnt>2466</ptvctcnt>      </sdtsterm>    </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <gridsys>          <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System</gridsysn>          <spcs>            <spcszone>2001</spcszone>            <lambertc>              <stdparll>41.716667</stdparll>              <stdparll>42.683333</stdparll>              <longcm>-71.500000</longcm>              <latprjo>41.000000</latprjo>              <feast>656166.666667</feast>              <fnorth>2460625.000000</fnorth>            </lambertc>          </spcs>        </gridsys>        <planci>          <plance>coordinate pair</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>0.000016</absres>            <ordres>0.000016</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>survey feet</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>        <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257222</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>    <vertdef>      <altsys>        <altdatum>National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929</altdatum>        <altres>1.000000</altres>        <altenc>Explicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates</altenc>      </altsys>    </vertdef>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <detailed>      <enttyp>        <enttypl>Fire Hydrants</enttypl>        <enttypd>ESRI Shapefile.
