Data included here was derived from the "Catalog of Significant Earthquakes 2150 B.C. to the present : including quantitative casualties and damage," by Paula K. Dunbar, Patricia A. Lockridge, and Lowell S. Whitewide (a National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) publication).  Post-1991 data is supplemented by the USGS/National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC).  This catalog is available as an online database, with significant earthquake data kept up-to-date, on the NGDC Web site. The events were gathered from scientific and scholarly sources, regional and worldwide catalogs, and individual event reports. The list includes all events that meet at least one of the following criteria:Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more); Ten or more deaths; Magnitude 7.5 or greater; Intensity X or greater (for events lacking magnitude)</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to geomorphology or geological analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on urban and rural land use planning and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <supplinf>Caveat [from National Geophysical Data Center, Catalog of Significant Earthquakes ... Web site].Erroneous statistical conclusions can be drawn from the numbers of earthquakes taken from Catalog of Significant Earthquakes, 2150 B.C. to the present. The reporting of large or destructive earthquakes is not homogeneous in space or time, particularly for periods prior to the 1900s. Because this publication mainly lists those earthquakes that have caused death or damage, the number of earthquake reports is dependent on the written history available for a particular region, as well as on the rate of development of population centers and related structures. Therefore, it is misleading to use the numbers of significant earthquakes in that publication to suggest statistically that there has been an increase in worldwide seismic activity since 1900 or for any time period. that "apparent" increase in activity: Instrumental seismology is a young science. The first calibrated instruments to measure seismic waves traveling through the earth did not appear until the late 1800s. At that time, seismologists became aware of the vast numbers of earthquakes occurring throughout the world, but because of the insensitivity of their instruments they were able to locate only the large magnitude events. The 1960s saw two major advances. First, a network of seismological observatories, the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN), was installed by the United States Government, principally to monitor underground nuclear tests. These sensitive instruments could detect and identify earthquakes anywhere in the world from about magnitude 4.5. Second computers became available in the late 1960s. Computers allowed seismologists to leave inaccurate and cumbersome graphical methods of locating earthquakes, and to process the increasing volume of new network data more rapidly than ever before. Prior to 1962, only hundreds of earthquake epicenters were determined each year by Government and academic institutions, but the number increased to the thousands using computerized location methods. In some special local studies, more than 100,000 earthquakes per year were identified and located. In summary, using the data in Catalog of Significant Earthquakes, 2150 B.C. to the present to suggest that there has been an increase in worldwide earthquake activity is misleading and erroneous. The above observations and reporting factors must also be considered when making statistical studies based on that historical data report.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <rngdates>          <begdate>bc2150</begdate>          <enddate>1994</enddate>        </rngdates>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-179.900000</westbc>        <eastbc>180.000000</eastbc>        <northbc>70.800000</northbc>        <southbc>-61.000000</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Earthquakes</themekey>        <themekey>Seismic event location</themekey>        <themekey>Seismology</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>LCSH</placekt>        <placekey>Earth</placekey>        <placekey>Northern Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Southern Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Eastern Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Western Hemisphere</placekey>        <placekey>Africa</placekey>        <placekey>Asia</placekey>        <placekey>Australia</placekey>        <placekey>Europe</placekey>        <placekey>North America</placekey>        <placekey>South America</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None.</accconst>    <useconst>For educational non-commercial use only.
