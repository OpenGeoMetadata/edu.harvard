Removed features not in the United States or its territories. Added STATE, KNOWN_ERUP and MAX_VEI attributes from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. National Atlas Volcanoes. For the four records that did not match, attribute STATE was coded from the LOCATION attribute and attributes ELEVATION, KNOWN_ERUP, and MAX_VEI were coded, -99999,  -999, and -999 respectively. Rearranged and removed attributes to match the last release. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.
