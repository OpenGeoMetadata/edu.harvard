Selected the public transport stop, railway station, and ferry terminal features. Renamed field FEATTYP to MNFC. Added field FCC and calculated its values based on MultiNet FEATTYP equivalents. Added field FEATTYPE and copied its values from MultiNet FEATTYP descriptions. Added field TEXTLENGTH and calculated its values to the length of the text in the NAME field. Added the STCTYFIPS field and coded it by overlaying on 2009 Data Update U.S. Counties. Converted the data set to SDC.
