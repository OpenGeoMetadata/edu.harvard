The landslides and debris flows shown in this coverage were mapped using 1:40,000-scale and 1:15,000-scale black-and-white aerial photographs.  Much of the photography was taken a few months after the storm, but additional photography was taken in late 2000.  The photographs were visually examined using 4-X mirror stereoscopes, and the landslides were plotted by hand on mylar overlays that were registered to topographic maps.  The landslides were plotted on 1:25,000-scale maps where these high-quality maps were available; for other parts of the country, the landslides were plotted on 1:50,000-scale maps.  The plotted landslides were then manually digitized and registered to digital raster graphic (DRG) images of 1:50,000-scale topographic maps.  Some of the areas in this coverage are composites of parts of two or more 1:50,000-scale quadrangles.  To produce these composites, the edges of adjoining quadrangles had to be digitally adjusted in ArcInfo to assure continuity between adjacent maps.  These adjustments were also necessary to resolve differences in the resolution between 1:50,000-scale and 1:25,000-scale topographic maps. After these adjustments, the areas of each plate were cut from merged DRGs and the digital landslides were then plotted on the DRG images of the map areas.  The cover portrays the shapes, relative location, and size of landslides and the associated downslope channel deposits caused by the hurricane.  For those features that were originally mapped on 1:25,000-scale topographic maps, we estimate that their locations are accurate to within less than 100 m and probably to within 50m.  For features that were originally mapped on 1:50,000-scale topographic maps, their locations are probably accurate to within 100-200m.Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America during the months of October-November of 1998. From 1998 to 2001 the US Geological Survey was involved along with other federal agencies in the reconstruction effort. The source CD consists of a compilation of GIS data layers and computer applications focused on hazard prevention and useful in municipal planning. Each dataset includes layers for a base area of one hundred square kilometers around the urban center of each municipality in the Hurricane Mitch project.</abstract>      <purpose>The coverage shows the distribution of slope failures and the associated deposits caused by Hurricane Mitch in El Salvador.  The cover included maps of these features in widely separated parts of the country.  The maps provide an inventory of these features and also contain a few recent landslides that predate the hurricane.  When data from this inventory is combined with geotechnical data on the physical properties of material on hill slopes, the hillslope form, and rainfall intensity and duration information, this coverage can be used as a basis for evaluating landslide susceptibility in similar areas of the country.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>20011205</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source data set publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-89.186203</westbc>        <eastbc>-89.110825</eastbc>        <northbc>14.345521</northbc>        <southbc>14.257854</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Landslides</themekey>        <themekey>Debris avalanches</themekey>        <themekey>Earthflows</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNS</placekt>        <placekey>El Salvador</placekey>        <placekey>Chalatenango, Departamento de</placekey>        <placekey>La Palma</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>None</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntperp>          <cntper>Peter G.

Some photographs were part of a cooperative program between the Japanese International Cooperative Agency (JICA) and the Government of El Salvador and are available the the Salvadoran National Geographic Institute (IGN).  Other photographs were acquired by the USGS  under contract and are archive at the USGS's Eros Data Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  Digital Raster Graphics (DRG) scanned images of 1:50,000-scale quadrangles projected to Transverse Mercator were used as base maps for the mapping.  We mapped the cloud cover by first locating it on the aerial photographs using a mirror stereoscope and then manually plotting by inspection a polygon that best represented the shape and size of the landslides onto the base maps. Many of base maps were at a scale of 1:25,000-scale; for some areas, only 1:50,000-scale base maps were available.  The mapped areal extent of the landslides were digitized, and then digitally registered to the DRG base maps.   Final maps are presented at 1:50,000 scale.</procdesc>        <srcused>Aerial photos</srcused>        <procdate>200110</procdate>        <srcprod>USGS hard drive</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntperp>              <cntper>Anthony J Crone</cntper>              <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, CR</cntorg>            </cntperp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>              <address>Mail Stop 966P.O.
