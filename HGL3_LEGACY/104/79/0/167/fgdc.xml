The statistical data contained here was collected as part of the U.S. Census of Population and Housing and originally published as part of the 1990 Census. Therefore the currentness reference date for the tabular data here is April 1, 1990.  For more information on the definitions and enumeration process please read the "Supplemental Information" and "Attribute Accuracy Statement" sections which follow. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001.The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <supplinf>The following information pertains to the terms used by the U.S. Census Bureau to define those categories of the population included in this layer. Parts of the following were transcribed from the glossary available through the U.S. Census Fact Finder website at: http://factfinder.census.govThe marital status classification identifies four major categories: never married, married, widowed, and divorced. These terms refer to the marital status at the time of the enumeration. The category "married" is further divided into "married, spouse present," "separated," and "other married, spouse absent." A person was classified as "married, spouse present" if the husband or wife was reported as a member of the household, even though he or she may have been temporarily absent on business or on vacation, visiting, in a hospital, etc., at the time of the enumeration. People reported as separated included those with legal separations, those living apart with intentions of obtaining a divorce, and other people permanently or temporarily separated because of marital discord. The group "other married, spouse absent" includes married people living apart because either the husband or wife was employed and living at a considerable distance from home, was serving away from home in the Armed Forces, had moved to another area, or had a different place of residence for any other reason except separation as defined above.Single, when used as a marital status category, is the sum of never-married, widowed, and divorced people. "Single," when used in the context of "single-parent family/household," means only one parent is present in the home. The parent may be never-married, widowed, divorced, or married, spouse absent.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>200107</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-73.508240</westbc>        <eastbc>-69.927802</eastbc>        <northbc>42.886818</northbc>        <southbc>41.237962</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>boundaries</themekey>        <themekey>society</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Demography</themekey>        <themekey>Population geography</themekey>        <themekey>Census</themekey>        <themekey>Marital status</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</placekt>        <placekey>Massachusetts</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.

No specific field tests for attribute accuracy have been conducted on the files.Marital Status AttributesThe data on marital status were derived from answers to questionnaire item 6, which was asked of all persons. The marital status classification refers to the status at the time of enumeration. Data on marital status are tabulated only for persons 15 years old and over. All persons were asked whether they were "now married," "widowed," "divorced," "separated," or "never married." Couples who live together (unmarried persons, persons in common-law marriages) were allowed to report the marital status they considered the most appropriate. Never Married:Includes all persons who have never been married, including persons whose only marriage(s) was annulled. Now Married, Except Separated:Includes persons whose current marriage has not ended through widowhood, divorce, or separation (regardless of previous marital history). The category may also include couples who live together or persons in common-law marriages if they consider this category the most appropriate. In certain tabulations, currently married persons are further classified as "spouse present" or "spouse absent." Separated:Includes persons legally separated or otherwise absent from their spouse because of marital discord. Included are persons who have been deserted or who have parted because they no longer want to live together but who have not obtained a divorce. Widowed:Includes widows and widowers who have not remarried. Divorced:Includes persons who are legally divorced and who have not remarried. In selected sample tabulations, data for married and separated persons are reorganized and combined with information on the presence of the spouse in the same household. Now Married:All persons whose current marriage has not ended by widowhood or divorce. This category includes persons defined above as "separated." Spouse Present:Married persons whose wife or husband was enumerated as a member of the same household, including those whose spouse may have been temporarily absent for such reasons as travel or hospitalization. Spouse Absent:Married persons whose wife or husband was not enumerated as a member of the same household. This category also includes all married persons living in group quarters. Spouse Absent, Other:Married persons whose wife or husband was not enumerated as a member of the same household, excluding separated. Included is any person whose spouse was employed and living away from home or in an institution or absent in the Armed Forces.</attraccr>    </attracc>    <complete>Data completeness of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) files reflects the contents of the database at the time the files were created. Data for a given category contain attribute codes that reflect the information portrayed on the original source.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas' (MEA) mission to profile the Commonwealth's people and institutions did not require the highest level of positional accuracy.  Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places.  The positional accuracy of these coordinates may not be as great as the six decimal places suggest. The six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps as it allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs</origin>            <title>MassGIS Town Boundaries</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>online</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>1999</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>MassGIS</srccitea>        <srccontr>Town boundaries derived from MassGIS Town boundaries (with coastline) dataset</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</origin>            <title>1990 Census of Population and Housing  Summary Tape File (STF-3)</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>19900401</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Summary Tape File 3 (STF3)</srccitea>        <srccontr>Tabular data for population statistics derived from this source.</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>See Citation information for this datalayer</origin>            <pubdate>200107</pubdate>            <title>Massachusetts Electronic Atlas</title>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>computer program</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200107</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>MEA Database</srccitea>        <srccontr>Town boundary data and Attribute tabular data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Tabular data compiled and edited from US Census Bureau STF-3; Town boundary data derived from MassGIS database.
