It is a digital version of the geology features of H.M. Beikman and P.B. King's Geologic Map of the United States, originally published at a scale of 1:2,500,000 (1974).  This version of the datalayer was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database (2003). The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is a general purpose United States geology datalayer intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-economic and political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.(description of original map production from King and Beikman, 1974) :    First of all, the map displays the rocky foundations on which our of investigation of this foundation by a succession of geologists.  It is thus a reference work that present and future geologists of the country can consult and is of prime importance in the education of earth scientists in schools and colleges.  Further, it can be consulted by geologists in other countries and continents who wish to learn about the geology of the United States;  they will compare the map with similar national or continental maps of their own countries.   In terms of resources useful to man, the Geologic Map lays out accurately the major regions of bedrock in the United States upon which many facets of our economy depend.  It illustrates the areas of stratified rocks that are the sources of most of our fuels, and the areas of crystalline, plutonic, and volcanic rocks that contain important parts of mineral wealth.  The map shows areas of complex folding and faulting, parts of which are still tectonically unstable and subject to earthquake hazards.  To some extent the bedrock represented on the map also influences surface soils, which are of interest in agriculture and engineering works.        Beyond this, the practical value of the map is less tangible, although it can be an important tool for the discerning user. Clearly, the map will not pinpoint the location of the next producing oil well or the next bonanza mine, nor will it give specific advice for the location of a dam or reactor site;  these needs can only be satisfied by maps on much larger scales, designed for specific purposes.  Nevertheless, the sapient exploration geologist can find upon it significant regional features not apparent to the untrained user.  Many great petroleum pools occur in stratigraphic traps, or "wedge belts of porosity," caused by overlap or truncation, the regional occurrence of which can be seen on the map.  Important mineral deposits cluster along regional tectonic trends or chains of plutons of specific ages. Finally, the Geologic Map will be used in national planning activities in conjunction with other national maps showing environmental features such as climate, vegetation, and land use--for the location of power transmission corridors, highways, National Parks, wilderness areas, reclamation projects, and the like.</purpose>      <supplinf>The first published digital version of Beikman and King's map for use in a GIS was produced by the USGS in 1994 on CD-ROM, entitled: Geology of the conterminous United States at 1:2,500,000 scale : a digital representation of the 1974 P.B. King and H.M. Beikman map.  The datalayer was also later made available for download as a ZIP ArcInfo Interchange File from the USGS Web site (http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS20950).  Comparing the Interchange File from the USGS Web site with Global GIS datalayer (2003) shows the same number of features (12,934), but attribute fields are slightly modified, including a 'Period' field in the Global GIS version which does not appear as an attribute in the USGS Interchange File version.The text: Explanatory text to accompany the geologic map of the United States, by H.M. Beikman and P.B. King (USGS Professional Paper 901, 1974) describes the historical background of the original paper map, details of the compilation process, and limitations to interpretation.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <mdattim>          <sngdate>            <caldate>1974</caldate>          </sngdate>          <sngdate>            <caldate>2003</caldate>          </sngdate>        </mdattim>      </timeinfo>      <current>Publication date of the original work (1974) and the Global GIS DVD (2003)</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>not planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-124.760803</westbc>        <eastbc>-66.957794</eastbc>        <northbc>49.371742</northbc>        <southbc>24.544790</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Geology</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>LCSH</placekt>        <placekey>United States</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>none</accconst>    <useconst>none</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntperp>          <cntper>Paul Schruben</cntper>          <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>        </cntperp>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>          <address>954 National Center</address>          <city>Reston</city>          <state>VA</state>          <postal>22092-9998</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>(703) 648-6142</cntvoice>        <cntfax>(703) 648-6383</cntfax>        <cntemail>pschrube@usgs.gov</cntemail>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>Data General AViiON 6220 computer system running the DG/UX version of UNIX.</native>    <crossref>      <citeinfo>        <origin>King, Philip Burke, 1903-</origin>        <origin>Beikman, Helen M.</origin>        <pubdate>1974</pubdate>        <title>Explanatory text to accompany the geologic map of the United States</title>        <geoform>document</geoform>        <serinfo>          <sername>United States.

The final mosaic was adjusted several times to correct for registration problems.  The coastline was taken from the 1:2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987), generalized to 1 km.Construction of a geologic map of an area as large and complex as the conterminous United States requires a great deal of generalization: geologic units shown on larger scale maps are combined into broader map units and their contacts are simplified to produce a pattern that is legible at the scale of publication.  The process of generalization used in the compilation of the Geologic Map of the United States is described in King and Beikman (1974, p. 20).Furthermore, the Geologic Map of the United States is primarily a bedrock map, which depicts geologic materials present beneath the soil or relatively thin mantles of surficial deposits, not necessarily the surficial materials themselves.  For example, the map does not depict the glacial deposits in the northern States, the widespread eolian deposits in the High Plains, and the high-level gravels that mantle older Tertiary and pre-Tertiary units in much of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains.</attraccr>    </attracc>    <logic>Polygon and chain-node topology present.</logic>    <complete>The map does not include coverage of Alaska, Hawaii, or territories.The Geologic Map of the United States is primarily a bedrock map, which depicts geologic materials present beneath the soil or relatively thin mantles of surficial deposits, not necessarily the surficial materials themselves.

The county outlines, cities, drainage, and other base-map information are not present on the digital version.The larger geology polygons are split into several smaller polygons to avoid problems with color and pattern fill on screen plots and paper plotters. The maximum polygon size is 1476 vertices, which is PostScript compatible.The rock-unit names are stored in uppercase letters as well as the published mixed case.  For instance: &gt; TMC   Tmc&gt; TMOE  Tmoe&gt; UTA   uTaThe uppercase names are used in the coverage because an INFO sort in ARC/INFO is case sensitive.  The lookup tables must be sorted to work correctly.  The mixed-case rock-unit names are in the kbcolor.lut lookup table.  Longer rock-unit descriptions such as:&gt; Cretaceous granitic rocks&gt; Washita Groupare in the ROCKDESC column of the .pat file of the KBLEG coverage.  Some of the unit names have been modified to avoid ambiguity.The Pennsylvanian symbol is stored as PP in:&gt;     PP&gt;     PP1&gt;     PP1a&gt;     PP2&gt;     PP3&gt;     PP4The Triassic symbol is stored as Tr in:&gt;     JTr&gt;     Tr&gt;     TrPe&gt;     Trv&gt;     Tri&gt;     TrgThe Cambrian symbol is stored as C in:&gt;     C&gt;     Cq&gt;     OC&gt;     Ce&gt;     Cv&gt;     Cg&gt; m1 is replaced with mm1 to avoid confusion with M1&gt; m2 is replaced with mm2 to avoid confusion with M2&gt; m3 is replaced with mm3 to avoid confusion with M3&gt; m4 is replaced with mm4 for consistencyThe extent of glaciation appears in the legend but is not present in the datalayer.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The users of the geologic map on this datalayer should respect the intentions of the compilers of the map and some of its limitations.  The Geologic Map of the United States (King and Beikman, 1974) is intended to be used at a scale of 1:2,500,000; it is not intended to be used at a more detailed scale.
