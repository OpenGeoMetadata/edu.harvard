It was published &amp; sold by John Sullivan, Junr. in 1806. Scale [ca. 1:1,700,000]. This layer is image 4 of 7 total images of the eight sheet source map, representing the west central portion of the map.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Albers (NAD 1983) projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, boundaries, selected townships and roads, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown pictorially and by hachures.  Includes also a table of the ports of entry in the United States and a table showing the length and breadth of each state.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract><purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1806</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>source map publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-99.749100</westbc><eastbc>-84.885072</eastbc><northbc>44.717467</northbc><southbc>33.348838</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>LCSH</themekt><themekey>Maps</themekey><themekey>Human settlements</themekey><themekey>Cities and towns</themekey><themekey>Villages</themekey><themekey>Landforms</themekey><themekey>Bodies of water</themekey><themekey>Transportation</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey></theme><place><placekt>LCSH</placekt><placekey>East (U.S.)</placekey></place><place><placekt>GNIS</placekt><placekey>Alabama</placekey><placekey>Arkansas</placekey><placekey>Connecticut</placekey><placekey>Delaware</placekey><placekey>District of Columbia</placekey><placekey>Florida</placekey><placekey>Georgia</placekey><placekey>Illinois</placekey><placekey>Indiana</placekey><placekey>Iowa</placekey><placekey>Kentucky</placekey><placekey>Louisiana</placekey><placekey>Maine</placekey><placekey>Maryland</placekey><placekey>Massachusetts</placekey><placekey>Michigan</placekey><placekey>Minnesota</placekey><placekey>Mississippi</placekey><placekey>Missouri</placekey><placekey>New Hampshire</placekey><placekey>New Jersey</placekey><placekey>New York</placekey><placekey>North Carolina</placekey><placekey>Ohio</placekey><placekey>Pennsylvania</placekey><placekey>Rhode Island</placekey><placekey>South Carolina</placekey><placekey>Tennessee</placekey><placekey>Vermont</placekey><placekey>Virginia</placekey><placekey>West Virginia</placekey><placekey>Wisconsin</placekey></place><place><placekt>GNS</placekt><placekey>Canada</placekey><placekey>Ontario</placekey><placekey>Qu√©bec</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard Map Collection</address><address>Pusey Library</address><address>Harvard University</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></ptcontac><native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3</native><crossref><citeinfo><origin>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard Library</origin><origin>Carleton, Osgood, 1742-1816.</origin><origin>Sullivan, John, publisher.</origin><pubdate>201211</pubdate><title>Eastern United States, 1806 (Image [x] of 7) (Raster Image)</title><geoform>map</geoform><pubinfo><pubplace>Cambridge, Massachusetts</pubplace><publish>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</publish></pubinfo><othercit>7 images</othercit><onlink>http://hgl.harvard.edu/</onlink></citeinfo></crossref></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process. In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 19557.77864 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Carleton, Osgood, 1742-1816.</origin><origin>Sullivan, John, publisher.</origin><pubdate>1806</pubdate><title>A new map of the United States of America : including part of Louisiana, drawn from the latest authorities</title><geoform>map</geoform><pubinfo><pubplace>Boston</pubplace><publish>Published &amp; sold by John Sullivan, Junr.</publish></pubinfo><othercit>1 map on 8 sheets : hand col. ; 120 x 137 cm., sheets 79 x 58 cm. or smaller.Sheet 4 of 8</othercit></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>1700000</srcscale><typesrc>paper</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1806</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>Paper Map</srccitea><srccontr>Source map for raster image</srccontr></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder 5.x capture software). Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were processed Adobe Photoshop. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc><srcused>Paper Map</srcused><procdate>2005</procdate><srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>D-Level, Room D-30</address><address>Widener Library</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles. For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as a base map for reference: ESRI Data and Maps 2010:  U.S. National Atlas Water Feature Areas (1:1,000,000); and U.S. National Atlas Water Feature Lines (1:1,000,000). In addition to the vector data listed above, this TIFF was also georeferenced to an adjacent plate(s) from the same map: Plate C. The base map data is projected in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Albers (NAD 1983) projected coordinate system, and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.A world file (.tfw) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image. Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc><srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused><procdate>2011</procdate><srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard University Information Technology</address><address>Library Technology Services</address><address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct><rastinfo><rasttype>Pixel</rasttype><rowcount>5764</rowcount><colcount>7458</colcount><vrtcount>1</vrtcount></rastinfo></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><mapproj><mapprojn>Albers Conical Equal Area</mapprojn><albers><stdparll>42.122774</stdparll><stdparll>49.015180</stdparll><longcm>-83.248627</longcm><latprjo>45.568977</latprjo><feast>1000000.000000</feast><fnorth>1000000.000000</fnorth></albers></mapproj><planci><plance>row and column</plance><coordrep><absres>156.987695</absres><ordres>197.991043</ordres></coordrep><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn><ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
