Condominiums are the source of most of the remaining inaccuracies.  This is because the Assessor's CAMA database structure has no means (in 1998) for correctly modeling the one-to-many relationship between the land of the parcel and its condominium units.  This has often resulted in the SBL being modified with a letter extension, one for each of the condominium units.  This has sometimes eliminated the SBL for the original lot all together, leaving the CAMA database unsynchronized with the Assessor's maps.Note that most Section/block/lot (SBL) IDs have a space between the block and the lot.  This space is occasionally filled by a letter extension to the block (e.g. 23023 0004 vs. 23023A0004).  Note also that SBLs with a section of 99 and a block of 099 are "dummy" SBLs.  These are created as placeholders for polygons such as ponds and median strips that must have a centroid to preserve topology but are not property parcels.  A dummy SBL was assigned to avoid confusion.  These "dummy" SBLs do not appear in the Assessors CAMA database.</attraccr>    </attracc>    <logic>For layers containing line or polygon features, Newton's data layers are "topologically clean". This was verified with Arc/Info software version 7.x in 1998 and is an ongoing part of data maintenance for the relevant data layers.</logic>    <complete>All buildings added from the permits are identified in the .PAT attribute source.  So if in the future more accurate mapping can be undertaken, the buildings that would need to be mapped can be identified.  While building demolitions do require a permit, as of 1998, only buildings being replaced by new construction are removed.  Smaller structures such as sheds and garages that are torn down are not being systematically removed.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>Buildings added to or augmented as part of data maintenance are digitized from building permits.  The control for this process is junctions in the parcel boundaries common to both the parcel data layer and the building permit.  The accuracy of this process is not known but consistently produces updates to this data layer that "look right".  Since the information on the building permits is from a survey, it's relative accuracy is very high.  However, using the parcel boundary junctions as control means that the placement of the building outline relative to the parcel boundaries cannot be any more accurate than the parcel data layer.All of the data provided to Newton by BECo. were captured photogrammetrically from aerial photography taken in the spring of 1991. The contract specifications were for producing maps at 1" = 100' with a horizontal accuracy of +/- 2.5'.  The photo negatives approximate scale was 1" = 600'.  The photography's survey control specifications were for Second Order Class II or better --state plane feet; NAD83 for horizontal control.No systematic and quantitative review of property boundary accuracy has ever been conducted.  However, several qualitative observations based on experience using the data are possible.  The street right-of-way lines overlay the orthophoto base map very well, falling on or close to the apparent back-of-sidewalk visible on the photos.The edge-of-pavement data layer was compiled from aerial photography for Boston Edison to an absolute accuracy specification of +/- 2.5 feet.  Again, the right-of-way lines match up well in this comparison.  Less is known about the accuracy of the internal property boundaries.  Casual observations suggest they are sometimes as accurate as the right-of-way lines and sometimes much less.  Some observations of boundary line discrepancies relative to property boundary lines such as fences and hedges visible on the orthophotos indicate that internal property boundaries may be off by at least +/- 5 feet.</horizpar>      </horizpa>      <vertacc>        <vertaccr>The photography's survey control specifications were for Second Order Class II or better --  NAVD29 for vertical control.Flying height of the aircraft from which the aerial photographs were taken was approximately 3600 feet (+/- 2% low or +/- 7% high) above ground elevation.</vertaccr>      </vertacc>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Boston Edison Company (BECo.)</origin>            <title>Boston Edison Company (BECo.)
