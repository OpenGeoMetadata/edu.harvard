According to 314 CMR 4.00: "Certain waters shall be designated for protection under this provision in 314 CMR 4.06(3) including Public Water Supplies (314 CMR 4.06(1)(d)1.). These waters constitute an outstanding resource as determined by their outstanding socioeconomic , recreational, ecological and/or aesthetic values. The quality of these waters shall be protected and maintained." (March 1, 1995).The data here were originally produced by MassGIS; This layer was then derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.For more information on the original MassGIS datalayer please consult their website at:http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/orw.htm</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>199703</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>ground condition</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-73.509495</westbc>        <eastbc>-69.893889</eastbc>        <northbc>42.878052</northbc>        <southbc>41.390768</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>boundaries</themekey>        <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>        <themekey>utilitiesCommunication</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Hydrography</themekey>        <themekey>Water supply</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>Alexandria Digital Library Feature Type Thesaurus</themekt>        <themekey>Hydrographic features</themekey>        <themekey>Drainage basins</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</placekt>        <placekey>Massachusetts</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.

Additional water supply watershed information was gathered from overlaying existing data onto USGS 1:25,000 quads and delineating additional watersheds.From: MassGIS website process steps description for their "Drainage Sub-basins" datalayer:"A set of 1:24,000 USGS paper quad sheets was delineated into approximately 2200 minor or drainage sub-basins. This work was produced over the past 20 years mainly by the USGS-WRD. Generally, the contours on the quads are the primary guide to basin boundaries. Often the 'mouth' of a basin is marked at the site of a stream gaging station, which can be different from the strict geographic location of the mouth.All sub-basins on the manuscripts were digitized. Due to good manuscript quality, including the visual edgematching of the 189 sheets, digitizing and edgematching was straightforward. The manuscript author was consulted on the minor errors and ambiguities that were discovered. Drainage boundaries added to Cape Cod were created by the Massachusetts Bays Program (the boundary separating drainage between Nantucket Sound/Cape Code Bay/Atlantic Ocean) and the Buzzards Bay Project (the boundary separating drainage between Buzzards Bay and Nantucket Sound/Cape Code Bay). The subdivisions were created by delineating groundwater divides using the 1:48,000 scale USGS Hydrologic Atlas Series maps. The delineations were reviewed for consistency by the USGS Water Resources Division, but they are not considered official basins of the USGS or the MA Water Resources Commission. In the fall of 1992 the MA Department of Environmental Protection Division of Water Supply added the state boundary and 1:100,000 coastline and extended or clipped the sub-basins to meet them. Additional drainage basins were delineated at the intake points of public water supplies. From these additional basins all upstream basins were coded as contributing to a surface public water supply. DEP regional staff determined which water supplies were primary and which were emergency or backup supplies, and the MDC provided the basins covered by MDC/MWRA jurisdiction."From the MassGIS website process steps description for their "Areas of Environmnetal Concerns"  datalayer:"Polygons are compiled from 1:25,000 USGS quad sheets, 1:5,000 ortho imagery, or other MassGIS datalayers and digitized. Boundaries were snapped to roads, political boundaries, water features, etc., depending on the feature defining the edge.  An effort was made to use the best available data at the time of editing.  Where the source data are at a lower resolution than the USGS quad, data were changed to provide "relative visual accuracy."  Where the source data are at a higher resolution than the USGS quad, the higher resolution data were usually kept."</procdesc>        <srcused>USGS Quads</srcused>        <procdate>Unknown</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>MassGIS</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>251 Causeway St., Suite 500</address>              <city>Boston</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02114</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>(617) 626-1000</cntvoice>            <cntfax>(617) 626-1249</cntfax>            <hours>Monday through Friday 9:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.

The basins of the surface water supplies were identified and if necessary additional drainage basins were delineated from the intake points of public water supplies. From these basins all upstream basins were coded as contributing to a surface public water supply. These basins were compared against the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards of 1995 to determine which basins were designated as containing Outstanding Resource Waters (ORW). Additional areas added included ACECs, drainage basins of protected scenic rivers, protected wetlands areas and areas that contribute to other states' surface water supplies. This information was extracted from the component datalayers and appended into a single ORW datalayer.</procdesc>        <procdate>Unknown</procdate>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>MassGIS (Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEO)</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>251 Causeway St.</address>              <address>Suite 500</address>              <city>Boston</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02114</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>(617) 626-1000</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617) 626-1249</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday through Friday 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.
