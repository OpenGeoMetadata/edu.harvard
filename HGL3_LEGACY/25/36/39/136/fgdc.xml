The statistical data contained here was collected as part of the U.S. Census of Population and Housing and originally published as part of the 1990 Census. The currentness reference date for the tabular data here is April 1, 1990, except in the case of rent as a percentage of income, which is 1989.For more information on the definitions and enumeration process please read the "Supplemental Information" section which follows. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001.The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.</abstract>      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <supplinf>The following information pertains to the terms used by the U.S. Census Bureau to define those categories of the population included in this layer. Parts of the following were transcribed from the glossary available through the U.S. Census Fact Finder website at: http://factfinder.census.govContract Rent:The data on contract rent (also referred to as "rent asked" for vacant units) were obtained from questionnaire item H7a, which was asked at all occupied housing units that were rented for cash rent and all vacant housing units that were for rent at the time of enumeration. Contract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of enumeration.If a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge is also paid by the renter to the owner, the respondent was instructed to include the fee or carrying charge. If a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the respondent was instructed to report the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers. The respondent was instructed to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, or a church or welfare agency. Median Contract Rent:The median divides the rent distribution into two equal parts. GROSS RENT:Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid for by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Gross rent is intended to eliminate differentials which result from varying practices with respect to the inclusion of utilities and fuels as part of the rental payment. The estimated costs of utilities and fuels are reported on a yearly basis but are converted to monthly figures for the tabulations. Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in 1989:Gross rent as a percentage of household income in 1989 is a computed ratio of monthly gross rent to monthly household income (total household income in 1989 divided by 12). The ratio was computed separately for each unit and was rounded to the nearest whole percentage. Units for which no cash rent is paid and units occupied by households that reported no income or a net loss in 1989 comprise the category "Not computed." This item is calculated on a sample basis.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>200107</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-73.508240</westbc>        <eastbc>-69.927802</eastbc>        <northbc>42.886818</northbc>        <southbc>41.237962</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>boundaries</themekey>        <themekey>society</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Population geography</themekey>        <themekey>Census</themekey>        <themekey>Housing</themekey>        <themekey>Rental housing</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</placekt>        <placekey>Massachusetts</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.

Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places.  The positional accuracy of these coordinates may not be as great as the six decimal places suggest. The six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps as it allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs</origin>            <title>MassGIS Town Boundaries</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>online</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>1999</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>MassGIS</srccitea>        <srccontr>Town boundaries derived from MassGIS Town boundaries (with coastline) dataset</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</origin>            <title>1990 Census of Population and Housing  Summary Tape File (STF-3)</title>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>19900401</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>Summary Tape File 3 (STF3)</srccitea>        <srccontr>Tabular data for population statistics derived from this source.</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>See Citation information for this datalayer</origin>            <pubdate>200107</pubdate>            <title>Massachusetts Electronic Atlas</title>            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <typesrc>computer program</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <sngdate>              <caldate>200107</caldate>            </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>MEA Database</srccitea>        <srccontr>Town boundary data and Attribute tabular data</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Tabular data compiled and edited from US Census Bureau STF-3; Town boundary data derived from MassGIS database.
