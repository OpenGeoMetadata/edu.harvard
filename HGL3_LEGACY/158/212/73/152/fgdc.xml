Those dams that are represented only by a graphic symbol are present as point data in the Drainage layer. All dams in this layer are also represented as points in Drainage Point coverage. These features are not always coincident with inland water shorelines.This layer was derived from the VMAP0 series produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly known as NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), an agency of the United States government. VMAP data set products use the "vector product format" (vpf). The term "VMap" is derived from "Vector Smart Map."Digital Chart of the World is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data. The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features.The coverage is  is organized into 10 thematic layers which feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographicially bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages.  DCW Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP0 libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. aeronautical features appear in a single layer, "Aeronautical Facilities, Points") which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas.  Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers. We have necessarily generalized the discussion of data source material and process steps in the Data Quality section of this metadata document.</abstract>      <purpose>The Digital Chart of the World is a general purpose global database designed to support Geographic Information Systems applications.This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-economic and political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <supplinf>Entities (features) and Attributes for DCW are fully described in: Department of Defense, 1992, Military Specification Digital Chart of the World (MIL-D-89009): Philadelphia, Department of Defense, Defense Printing Service  Detachment Office.The DCW used a product-specific attribute coding system that is composed of TYPE and STATUS designators for area, line, and point features; and LEVEL and SYMBOL designators for text features. The TYPE attribute specifies what  the feature is, while the STATUS attribute specifies the current condition of the feature. Some features require both a  TYPE and STATUS code to uniquely identify their characteristics. In order to uniquely identify each geographic  attribute in the DCW, the TYPE and STATUS attribute code names are preceded by the two letter coverage abbreviation and a two letter abbreviation for the type of graphic primitive present. The DCW Type/Status codes were mapped into the Feature Attribute Coding Catalogue (FACC) coding scheme. A full description of FACC may be found in The DIgital Geographic Information Exchange STandard (DIGEST) Edition 1.2, January 1994.Please consult the DIGEST FACC website for complete coding data.

As such, the data are extremely variable with regard to completeness. Data inclusion/exclusion in this coverage is highly dependent on the local occurrence of other types of visually distinctive features.Special automation techniques: All lines were manually digitized from film separate sources.Feature coincidence: CLLINE arcs do not have explicit coincidence with other features in the database.Database design issues: No special considerations.</logic>    <complete>100 percent of features depicted on the ONC source materials have been captured. 100 percent of the features have valid attribute codes assigned to them.

Source chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature attributes in the VMap-0 data quality coverage. The primary accuracy analysis was performed on one chart only in the prototyping phase of the DCW project. Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters. Detailed horizontal accuracy figures were developed by comparing the positions of well-defined points in the roads, railroads, utility lines, and drainage coverages against sources of higher accuracy, measuring the offsets, and expressing differences as a Circular Map Accuracy figure at a 90% confidence interval. This figure was independently verified by adding known production errors to source chart accuracies in a root sum square calculation.</horizpar>        <qhorizpa>          <horizpav>1,600 to 7,300</horizpav>          <horizpae>Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in feet.

The ONCs have a scale of 1:1,000,000, and they are the largest scale, unclassified map series produced by the DMA that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. Some collateral sources have been used to enhance road and railroad connectivity through selected urbanized areas. The DMA's Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) was the primary source for the airport data in the aeronautical layer.An Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) image for the coterminous United States is the source for the data in the Vegetation layer. The Defense Intelligence Agency Manual (DIAM) 65-18 is the source for the Geopolitical codes and the ocean boundaries information contained in the Political and Oceans layer. The product specifications for the ONCs and JNCs have been used extensively in the design of the database.</srccontr>      </srcinfo>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Defense Mapping Agency</origin>            <pubdate>1990</pubdate>            <title>Jet Navigational Chart</title>            <geoform>map</geoform>            <pubinfo />          </citeinfo>        </srccite>        <srcscale>2000000</srcscale>        <typesrc>stable-base material</typesrc>        <srctime>          <timeinfo>            <rngdates>              <begdate>1974</begdate>              <enddate>1991</enddate>            </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>        </srctime>        <srccitea>JNC</srccitea>        <srccontr>All information found on the source with the exception of aeronautical data.

The number of separates available for each source chart varied from seven to thirty pieces. Following reproduction, separates underwent an extensive map preparation process to verify registration, tic coincidence between separates, and to inventory the data present on each sheet. Where necessary, data represented with broken line symbols on the source were manually connected into continuous lines to facilitate the automation process. For example, the dash and dot symbols used to represent intermittent drainage were connected with drafting ink to become continuous, smooth lines. Map preparation tasks were verified through independent quality control inspection.Following map preparation, the data were automated. Point features were manually digitized using large-format CalComp 9100 digitizing boards. All line features were captured through optical scanning on a Scan-Graphics CF1000 scanner at a resolution of 500 dots per inch (DPI). Nearly all data were vectorized using Scan-Graphics RAVE software resident on a DEC VAX 6320 minicomputer. Some utility line data were captured using Hitachi CADCore/Tracer software in conjunction with 300-DPI scanned images. Vector output files were converted to a DXF format and transferred to the main processing environment.Following scanning/vectorization, the data were converted into an ARC/INFO coverage format (Rev. 5.0.1) in a Sun SPARC processing environment. After being converted to ARC/INFO, all coverages were transformed into a common inch coordinate space using an affine coordinate transformation. Manually digitized coverages were registered to this same tic set prior to digitizing, also using an affine transformation.Next, preliminary edits were performed to eliminate obvious errors, after which the data were plotted at scale using a CalComp 1044 pen plotter and then compared to the source for positional accuracy, topological correctness, completeness, and cartographic presentation quality. Positionally, all data were required to fall within a line width of their position on the source manuscript. Topologically, all line data were required to be connected as depicted on the ONCs, all polygons had to close, and no duplicate features were permitted. This comparison to source review was performed by staff independent of the editing process and was implemented in an iterative cycle until all known errors were resolved. All of the data layers were checked in this fashion. All edits were verified.Attribute codes were assigned by registering source manuscripts on digitizing boards, selecting features individually or in groups, and assigning numeric codes for the various attributes represented. Point and text features were coded interactively at the time of initial data capture. Following completion of initial attribute code assignment, all data were plotted and independently reviewed against source manuscripts for correctness. This process was implemented iteratively until all known errors were resolved. All of the data layers were checked in this fashion. All edits were verified. Annotation text string assignment was checked in a similar manner.Following finalization of cartographic features and associated attributes, all data (except for hypsography features) were plotted in a single composite plot on a CalComp 58000 color electrostatic plotter. This composite plot was compared to source lithographs by staff independent of the editing process to review the between-layer relationships of features and to eliminate final attribution errors. After this initial review/edit step, a second plot was sometimes generated to verify changes, depending on data density and the number of errors identified on the first plot. Not all features were explicitly tested at this stage. A set of automated checks was also applied to the data at this time, including tests for attribute code value validity, attribute code consistency, topology errors, attribute field definition correctness, and internal data structure correctness.To transform the data from digitizer inches into real-world coordinates, an appropriate number of registration points with known geographic latitude and longitude coordinates was selected from each ONC. These coordinates were entered into a master tic coverage and projected into the projection coordinate space of the source data (Lambert Conformal, Polar Stereographic, or Transverse Mercator, depending on source characteristics). Next, the projected master tic coordinates were associated with their corresponding points in the digitizer inch coverages. Using the ARC/INFO command TRANSFORM, affine transformation coefficients were computed, and the digitizer inch coverages transformed into real-world coordinates. The transformed coverages were then inverse projected into decimal degrees. Lambert Conformal and Polar Stereographic projection processing was performed using the ARC/INFO (Rev. 5.0.1) PROJECT library, which draws on standard United States Geological Survey (USGS) General Cartographic Transformation Package (GCTP) algorithms. Transverse Mercator (TM) projections were performed using algorithms developed by ESRI. TM-based charts occur only below ?60 degrees latitude. The data were then clipped to remove overlap areas between sheets in preparation for edgematching. Edgematching of features was done manually by quality control staff who marked the required connections on special color-coded electrostatic plots of border areas. The edgematch plot was then given to processing staff who matched the features indicated on the edgematch plots in the actual database. All edgematch processing was reviewed by quality control staff. If features along edges were irreconcilable in terms of position or attribution because of differences between ONC sheets, overlap areas on source manuscripts were utilized to resolve the discrepancies where possible. For features that were irreconcilable positionally, overlap areas on adjacent source charts were used to determine the definite positional relationship between features to be matched. Features were then physically moved in the database in order to establish a cartographically pleasing match, except in those cases where such a match would disturb the between-layer relationship of data in one of the modules. When it was necessary to alter feature position during edgematching, data from the less accurate sheet were always moved to match those on the more accurate one (as defined by DMA chart histories). In extreme situations where physical movement of arcs was not possible, but a clear definition as to which features should be matched existed, a section of the processing module border was inserted to maintain connectivity. These segments were explicitly coded as connector arcs within that layer. If two modules showed a difference in compilation date and the overlap area in the more recent sheet indicated greater connectivity for roads and railroads than the less recent module from which the data were automated, data from the more recent module were added to reflect this increased connectivity. These additions were explicitly coded as connectors. All other discrepancies between adjacent source sheets, including discrepancies in attribution that were not resolvable using the methods described above, were captured as is.Following edgematching, all of the mapping modules were physically merged and then subsequently split into five-degree by five-degree tiles using ARC/INFO LIBRARIAN Rev. 5.0.1 software. Any nonrequired former processing module (ONC) boundaries were then removed from polygon coverages using an ARC/INFO DISSOLVE operation. All polygon coverages were subjected to an additional automated process to ensure that features terminating at tile boundaries ended precisely at those boundaries. This was accomplished by identifying companion edge features on either side of each tile boundary, and snapping them to a common position along the mathematically generated boundary. Following these processes,a quality review was implemented to ensure that they had been performed correctly. This included interactive reviews of tiles, individually and in groups, and reviews of small-scale plots of all coverages.The following points are general technical characteristics that describe the data and/or the data production process:All data were registered using an affine transformation.Maximum allowable Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.004 inch, althoughvalues of 0.007 inch were accepted in some incidences (comprising no more than5 percent of the cases).All line data were generalized using the ARC/INFO GENERALIZE command with a tolerance of 0.0039 inch.Minimum polygon feature size is 0.12 inch (perimeter measure). This tolerance wasapplied using perimeter rather than area criteria to minimize the obstacles to polygon topology construction during data process operations. The layers most affected are the Political and Oceans, Drainage, and Hypsography layers.All line data have undergone coordinate densification at 0.55 inch followinggeneralization to maintain data integrity throughout projection processing.All line data have been processed using a maximum fuzzy tolerance of 0.002 inch.Polygon features from the Political and Oceans, Drainage, Populated Places, and Land Cover layers were first physically integrated and then separated into their respective feature classes.  As a result, the coordinates for area features, regardless of which coverage they reside in, have identical coordinate representations along common borders.  To facilitate the integration, a hierarchy was established to define the feature classes from which common borders would be extracted.  The order of precedence is as follows: 1) coastlines and inland water bodies (from the POPOLY and DNPOLY feature classes respectively), 2) city outlines (the PPPOLY feature class), and 3) land cover (the LCPOLY feature class).
