In areas where the Census Bureau has not realigned street features as part of MTAIP it meets, at best, the established National Map Accuracy standards (approximately +/-50 meters or 167 feet) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS were the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature changes added by its field staff or local updates or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line shapefiles may not be suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Census Bureau</origin><pubdate>2011</pubdate><title>2010 Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles</title><edition>2010</edition><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><serinfo><sername>Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles</sername><issue>2010</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Washington, DC, USA</pubplace><publish>U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</publish></pubinfo><onlink>http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2010/tgrshp2010.html</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>100000</srcscale><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><mdattim><sngdate><caldate>2010</caldate></sngdate><sngdate><caldate>2011</caldate></sngdate></mdattim></timeinfo><srccurr>ground condition: 2010; publication date: 2011</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>2010 Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles</srccitea><srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>TomTom North America, Inc.</origin><pubdate>201112; 201003</pubdate><title>TomTom MultiNet Administrative Areas</title><edition>Versions 2011.12 and 2010.03</edition><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><serinfo><sername>TomTom MultiNet North America</sername><issue>Versions 2011.12 and 2010.03</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA</pubplace><publish>TomTom North America, Inc.</publish></pubinfo><onlink>http://www.tomtom.com/</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>DVD-ROM</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><mdattim><sngdate><caldate>201112</caldate></sngdate><sngdate><caldate>201003</caldate></sngdate></mdattim></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>TomTom MultiNet North America Administrative Areas v. 2011.12 and v. 2010.03</srccitea><srccontr>Attribute and geospatial data</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Census Bureau</origin><pubdate>2011</pubdate><title>Summary File 1 (SF 1)</title><edition>2010</edition><serinfo><sername>Summary File 1 (SF 1)</sername><issue>2010</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Washington, DC, USA</pubplace><publish>Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</publish></pubinfo><othercit>The Summary File 1 (SF 1) data is based on the 2010 Census of Population and Housing.</othercit><onlink>http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/doc/sf1.pdf</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>online</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><mdattim><sngdate><caldate>2010</caldate></sngdate><sngdate><caldate>2011</caldate></sngdate></mdattim></timeinfo><srccurr>ground condition: 2010; publication date: 2011</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>U.S. Census SF 1</srccitea><srccontr>Attribute data</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Environmental Systems Research Institute (Redlands, Calif.)</origin><pubdate>20111027</pubdate><title>Esri Data</title><edition>2011</edition><geoform>tabular digital data</geoform><serinfo><sername>Esri Data</sername><issue>2011</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Redlands, California, USA</pubplace><publish>Esri</publish></pubinfo><onlink>http://www.esri.com</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>DVD-ROM</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20111027</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>Esri Data</srccitea><srccontr>Attribute data</srccontr></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Started with the Places data set from 2010 Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles.

Added field CLASS and calculated its values from values removed from the NAME field. Attached and formatted the fields from 2010 Census Summary File 1 and Esri Data. Added field POP_CLASS and calculated its population ranges based on POP2010. Added field SQMI and calculated its values projected to Albers Equal Area.
