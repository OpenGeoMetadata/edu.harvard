This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-economic and political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>      <abstract>This datalayer is a point coverage representing aeronautical facilities located throughout DCW (Digital Chart of the World) geographic coverage as of 1992.This layer was derived from the VMAP0 series produced by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly known as NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), an agency of the United States government. VMAP data set products use the "vector product format" (vpf). The term "VMap" is derived from "Vector Smart Map."Digital Chart of the World is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector basemap of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data. The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features.The coverage is  is organized into 10 thematic layers which feature a vast number of files organized into libraries. These libraries, or coverages, are geographicially bounded areas, rather than feature-linked coverages.  DCW Layers in the Harvard Geospatial Library are feature-based as we have processed the multiple tiles from the VMAP0 libraries into a series of seamless coverages (e.g. aeronautical features appear in a single layer, "Aeronautical Facilities, Points") which depict a particular feature as it occurs throughout the available geographic coverage areas.  Since different geographic areas were mapped by NIMA at different times using various types of feature capture and scanning and digitizing methods and software, multiple map sources of varying dates and multiple processing approaches are represented in each of these HGL layers. We have necessarily generalized the discussion of data source material and process steps in the Data Quality section of this metadata document.</abstract>      <supplinf>Entities (features) and Attributes for DCW are fully described in: Department of Defense, 1992, Military Specification Digital Chart of the World (MIL-D-89009): Philadelphia, Department of Defense, Defense Printing Service  Detachment Office.The DCW used a product-specific attribute coding system that is composed of TYPE and STATUS designators for area, line, and point features; and LEVEL and SYMBOL designators for text features. The TYPE attribute specifies what  the feature is, while the STATUS attribute specifies the current condition of the feature. Some features require both a  TYPE and STATUS code to uniquely identify their characteristics. In order to uniquely identify each geographic  attribute in the DCW, the TYPE and STATUS attribute code names are preceded by the two letter coverage abbreviation and a two letter abbreviation for the type of graphic primitive present. The DCW Type/Status codes were mapped into the Feature Attribute Coding Catalogue (FACC) coding scheme. A full description of FACC may be found in The DIgital Geographic Information Exchange STandard (DIGEST) Edition 1.2, January 1994.Please consult the DIGEST FACC website for complete coding data.

No duplicate features are present. All areas are completely described as depicted on the source manuscripts. No undershoots or overshoots are present. All data were consistently captured using the rules described in the narrative associated with the Data Quality Table and in the various feature table narrative files present at the coverage level within the library.Special automation techniquesPoints were derived from Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) DAFIF files, with the exception of airport locations within the borders of the former Warsaw Pact nations and other communist countries, including the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Albania. In the former case, DAFIF point locations were loaded into ARC/INFO, reformatted into a compatible file structure, and converted into ARC/INFO coverages using the ARC GENERATE command. Applicable attributes were initially maintained in a related file, and later joined to the feature attribute table. In the latter case, the information was derived from paper lithographic sources. Data captured from lithographs were recompiled onto a stable Mylar base, using local registration techniques over 1-degree areas. In this approach, 1-degree graticules were used to establish a network of local control, minimizing the effects of the unstable paper media to areas of this size. In extreme northern and southern latitudes (above approximately 70 degrees northor south), a local registration interval of 2 degrees was used. Following recompilation, the locations were manually digitized.Feature coincidence AE point locations do not have explicit coincidence with other features in the database.Database design issuesData derived from lithographic sources have an attribute of AEPTTYPE = 5. DAFIF-derived data have more available attributes than those derived from lithographic sources, which contain null values in the AEPTICAO and AEPTDKEY attribute fields.</logic>    <complete>100 percent of features depicted on the ONC source materials have been captured. 100 percent of the features have valid attribute codes assigned to them.  Airport features were derived from the DMA Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF).  Where DAFIF was incomplete, locations were added from the ONC.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The Horizontal Positional Accuracy Value represents overall accuracy. Source chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature attributes in the VMap-0 data quality coverage. The primary accuracy analysis was performed on one chart only in the prototyping phase of the DCW project. Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters. Detailed horizontal accuracy figures were developed by comparing the positions of well-defined points in the roads, railroads, utility lines, and drainage coverages against sources of higher accuracy, measuring the offsets, and expressing differences as a Circular Map Accuracy figure at a 90% confidence interval. This figure was independently verified by adding known production errors to source chart accuracies in a root sum square calculation.</horizpar>        <qhorizpa>          <horizpav>1,600 to 7,300</horizpav>          <horizpae>Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in feet.

The ONCs have a scale of 1:1,000,000, and they are the largest scale, unclassified map series produced by the DMA that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. Some collateral sources have been used to enhance road and railroad connectivity through selected urbanized areas. The DMA's Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) was the primary source for the airport data in the aeronautical layer.An Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) image for the coterminous United States is the source for the data in the Vegetation layer. The Defense Intelligence Agency Manual (DIAM) 65-18 is the source for the Geopolitical codes and the ocean boundaries information contained in the Political and Oceans layer.

These were digitized either through a scanning-raster to vector conversion or hand digitized into vector form. The vector data was then tagged with attribute information using ARC-INFO software. Transformation to geographic coordinates was performed using the projection graticules for each sheet. Digital information was edge matched between sheets to create large regional datasets. These were then subdivided into 5 x 5 degree tiles and converted from ARC/INFO to VPF. The data was then pre-mastered for CD-ROM.
