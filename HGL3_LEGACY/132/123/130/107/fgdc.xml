Added features for Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from the ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. Corrected attribute value consistency problems. Replaced the entire outer boundary of the continental U.S. (coastlines and international) with features from the U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. Generalized to a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Created region (multi-poly) features based on the four-digit state/district id. Then formatted the attributes to match the common attributes in the U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. The values for the attributes, NAME and PARTY, were completed from The Associated Press and National Committee for an Effective Congress. In two records, the winner was still undecided, and the NAME and PARTY attributes were coded with "TBD". Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>        <srcused>ESRI</srcused>        <srcused>AP</srcused>        <srcused>NCEC</srcused>        <srcused>Census Geo.</srcused>        <procdate>20021121</procdate>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Added SQMI attribute and calculated its values.

Updated the Maine and Texas boundaries. Updated the attribute values to represent the 109th Congress. Corrected the values for DISTRICTID attribute by changing 'xx99' to 'xx00'. Added the new value of 'Vacant' to the PARTY attribute. Recalculated the SQMI attribute values. Reduced the attribute width for NAME.</procdesc>        <srcused>Census Geo.</srcused>        <srcused>http://clerk.house.gov</srcused>        <srcused>Texas Legislative Council</srcused>        <srcused>Maine cngrss03</srcused>        <procdate>20050302</procdate>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Updated member information for the California 48th and 50th congressional districts, the Ohio 2nd congressional district, and the New Jersey 13th congressional district.

Downloaded 2006 TIGER/Line files for Pennsylvania from the U.S. Census Bureau website, extracted out block polygons, and converted to shapefile. Dissolved block polygons on the CD ID to create the updated Pennsylvania CD boundaries shapefile. Deleted old Pennsylvania features from the 109th CD shapefile and saved them into a separate shapefile. Extended all exterior boundaries of the updated Pennsylvania CD shapefile, and then clipped them back using the old Pennsylvania features to ensure coincidence with the adjacent state boundaries and with the coastline detail. Added and calculated attributes in the updated Pennsylvania shapefile, including new SQMI values, to match the 109th CD shapefile. Merged the updated Pennsylvania shapefile with the 109th CD shapefile. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>        <srcused>ESRI</srcused>        <srcused>AP</srcused>        <srcused>NCEC</srcused>        <srcused>Census Geo.</srcused>        <srcused>http://clerk.house.gov</srcused>        <srcused>Texas Legislative Council</srcused>        <srcused>Maine cngrss03</srcused>        <srcused>2006 Second Edition TIGER/Line</srcused>        <procdate>20070615</procdate>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2007 Data Update DVD.
