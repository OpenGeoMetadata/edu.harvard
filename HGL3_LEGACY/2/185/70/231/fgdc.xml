Selected features that intersected Data &amp; Maps 10 U.S. Counties to get the U.S. features only. Selected the public transport stop, railway station, and ferry terminal features. Renamed MultiNet field FEATTYP to MNFC. Added field FCC and calculated its values based on MultiNet FEATTYP equivalents. Added field FEATTYPE and copied its values from MultiNet FEATTYP descriptions. Added field TEXTLENGTH and calculated its values to the length of the text in the NAME field. Added the STCTYFIPS field and coded it by overlaying on Data &amp; Maps 10 U.S. Counties. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc><srcused>TomTom MultiNet North America v. 2011.09 and v. 2010.03</srcused><procdate>20111214</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>This layer was downloaded from the Esri Data and Maps 10.1 DVD.
