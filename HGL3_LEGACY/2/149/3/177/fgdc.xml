Downloaded the membership tables from http://clerkweb.house.gov/107/oalascii.txt and http://clerkweb.house.gov/107/oalmbr.php3 extracting and combining them.  Created a region shapefile by summarizing on DISTRICTID attribute.  Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting Hawaii from the United States; converting it to NAD83 (Hawaiian islands west of 161 degrees West longitude remain in Old Hawaiian Datum); then merging them together.  Reformatted attributes and their values in the shapefile table.  Reformatted attributes and values in membership table then joined it to the shapefile table. Created ArcGIS- layer file (.lyr) and ArcView legend file (.avl).  Copied and renamed projection file (.prj) and created spatial indices.</procdesc>        <srcused>Census Geo.</srcused>        <srcused>U.S. House Clerk</srcused>        <procdate>20020115</procdate>        <procdate>20020208</procdate>        <srcprod>Shape</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>ESRI</cntorg>              <cntper>Data Team</cntper>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>380 New York Street</address>              <city>Redlands</city>              <state>California</state>              <postal>92373-8100</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>909-793-2853</cntvoice>            <cntfax>909-793-5953</cntfax>            <cntemail>info@esri.com</cntemail>            <hours>8:00 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Pacific time, Monday-Friday</hours>            <cntinst>In the United States-Please direct all inquiries regarding software/data pricing and consulting services to your local ESRI Regional Office.
