GNIS is being compiled in phases. GNIS Phase I data compilation and edit - Feature name and attribute data were collected from the largest-scale USGS topographic maps available. These data were compared to the records of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. This phase is complete.GNIS Phase II data compilation and edit - Feature name and attribute data are collected from official state and local sources and other approved sources including historical maps and documents. This phase is not complete.GNIS Maintenance program - Federal and state maintenance cooperators submit new and corrected data in conjunction with their mapping and geographical information system data maintenance programs. The GNIS has an active data gathering and maintenance program. A web-based data date entry and edit application allows authorized users to submit transaction data directly for validation and entry into the database, where it immediately becomes available to all web services and applications. A test and demonstration site is available. Government agencies at all levels are encouraged to join this program. Other organizations and individuals will be considered on a case basis.Partnerships - the Geographic Names Project enters into partnerships with State names authorities and State and local GIS agencies to integrate name, location, and attribute data in the GNIS with State and local datasets. These partnerships utilize GIS and web technology to automate and simplify data maintenance, ensure data consistency, integrity, and accuracy, and meet the requirements of the Board on Geographic Names for national names standardization. Government agencies at all levels are encouraged to join this program. Other organizations and individuals will be considered on a case basis.</procdesc>        <procdate>Not complete</procdate>        <srcprod>USGS - GNIS</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the tabular files from the U.S. Geological Survey web site. Converted the files (containing latitude and longitude coordinates) to shapefiles in ArcMap and appended them into one data set. Re-projected Alaska and Hawaii to improve their alignment. Reselected out the nine GNIS data sets based on their class type. Removed features with incorrect coordinates. Adjusted the widths of the NAME attributes. Added the LABEL_FLAG attributes and calculated their values based on whether the features have a corresponding area in U.S. Large Area Landmarks. Converted the data sets to SDC.
