Ecoregions are defined as relatively large areas of land or water in the world containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions. This data set contains all terrestrial ecoregions, which include those of the Global 200. Global 200 ecoregions are a collection of the Earth's most outstanding and diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats where the Earth's biological wealth is most distinctive and rich, where its loss will be most severely felt, and we must protect if we are to preserve the web of life.

(1995) and Ricketts et al. (1999). We then consulted existing global maps of floristic or zoogeographic provinces, global and regional maps of units based on the distribution of selected groups of plants and animals, the world's biotic province maps, and global maps of broad vegetation types. These were useful for evaluating the extent of realms and biomes, the first two tiers in our hierarchical classification. We then identified published regional classification systems to be used as a baseline for ecoregion boundaries. Data and consultations from regional experts were also important for final ecoregion delineations.</procdesc>        <procdate>2001; 2005</procdate>        <srcprod>World Wildlife Fund</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the data set from World Wildlife Fund's FTP site. Removed attributes ECO_ID, ECO_CODE, ECO_SYM, G200_REGION, G200_BIOME, and G200_STAT. Renamed attribute GBL_STAT to STATUS. Adjusted the order and field widths of attributes. Added BIOME_DESC populating it with BIOME's descriptions. Added PRIORITY populating it with 'Yes' for every feature where G200_NUM is greater than zero. Deleted records where ECO_NAME = "". Made the features multi-part based on all attributes and reduced the record count from 14942 to 832.Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>        <srcused>World Wildlife Fund</srcused>        <procdate>20050211</procdate>        <srcprod>SDC</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>ESRI</cntorg>              <cntper>Data Team</cntper>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>380 New York Street</address>              <city>Redlands</city>              <state>California</state>              <postal>92373-8100</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>909-793-2853</cntvoice>            <cntfax>909-793-5953</cntfax>            <cntemail>info@esri.com</cntemail>            <hours>8:00 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Pacific time, Monday-Friday</hours>            <cntinst>In the United States-Please direct all inquiries regarding software/data pricing and consulting services to your local ESRI Regional Office.
