The sequence of the three-character FSA is always Alphabetical character/Number/Alphabetical character. The centroids are calculated from the DMTI Spatial FSA boundary file, which is created from the DMTI Spatial six-character postal code point file and CanMap(r). The FSA boundaries encompass the six-character postal code points starting with that FSA designation, and conform to the streets and other physical features within CanMap.</abstract>      <purpose>Canada FSA Postal Centroids provides the Forward Sortation Areas (FSA) of Canada with their population and number of dwellings.</purpose>      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:50,000.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <mdattim>          <sngdate>            <caldate>20001020</caldate>          </sngdate>          <sngdate>            <caldate>1996</caldate>          </sngdate>        </mdattim>      </timeinfo>      <current>publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-135.066895</westbc>        <eastbc>-52.711426</eastbc>        <northbc>70.780014</northbc>        <southbc>42.033581</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>location</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>None</themekt>        <themekey>point</themekey>        <themekey>postal codes</themekey>        <themekey>forward sortation areas</themekey>        <themekey>three-character postal codes</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>None</placekt>        <placekey>Canada</placekey>      </place>      <temporal>        <tempkt>None</tempkt>        <tempkey>2000</tempkey>        <tempkey>1996</tempkey>      </temporal>    </keywords>    <accconst>Access granted to Licensee only.</accconst>    <useconst>The data are provided under the Harvard University Site License.
