    <descript>
      <abstract>California ZIP Code Areas represents five-digit ZIP Code areas used by the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail more effectively.  The first digit of a five-digit ZIP Code divides the country into 10 large groups of states numbered from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in the far West.  Within these areas, each state is divided into an average of 10 smaller geographical areas, identified by the 2nd and 3rd digits.  These digits, in conjunction with the first digit, represent a sectional center facility or a mail processing facility area.  The 4th and 5th digits identify a post office, station, branch or local delivery area.</abstract>
      <purpose>California ZIP Code Areas provides area, post office name, and population for each ZIP Code area in California.</purpose>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition). To improve the accuracy, GDT ran a process against the entire nationwide database.  It was generalized to 1,000 points per polygon and 4,000 points per feature. Generalizing reduced the positional accuracy and can&apos;t be determined.  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth&apos;s surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>How GDT Creates These Files: Creating ZIP Code Areas is a technical process that carefully coordinates United States Postal Service (USPS) postal data and our own Dynamap street data.  The U.S. Post Office assigns ZIP Codes on a street-by-street basis. ZIP code areas are used by the USPS to deliver mail more effectively. Their purpose was never intended to form boundaries for spatial analysis. As a result, GDT formed the following processes to build boundaries from the mail stops present on street segments. By utilizing a wide variety of sources, GDT is able to locate ZIP code changes both large and small and change the representation of ZIP Code areas by redefining the boundaries.  Aligning ZIP Code Zones &amp; Street Segments: The ZIP boundaries are created manually by following actual Dynamap street segments and other non-street features. In areas where the street name match rate is low, GDT technicians make telephone inquiries to area Post Offices, and refer to USPS ZIP+4 State Directories, to determine the predominant ZIP Code. The ZIP Code delivery &quot;zone&quot; is approximated, and ZIP boundaries are created manually by following Dynamap street and non-street segments.  California ZIP Code Areas have been generalized to 1,000 points per polygon and 4,000 points per feature.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data sets from GDT Dynamap/2000 v10.0.  Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), then if present, merged Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia).  Recalculated any attributes based on area.  Removed blank records.  Aggregated based on Zip attribute.  Reduced attribute widths.  Recalculated Sumblkpop attribute by summing Census Block centroids defined by the Census Bureau from the Public Law 94-171 population files that fall within each ZIP Code area.  Added Pop2000 attribute from CACI International, Inc.  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.  Divided into individual states.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
