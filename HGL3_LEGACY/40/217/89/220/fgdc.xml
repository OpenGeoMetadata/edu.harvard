To understand the grid cell code within the one-degree rectangle, imagine a rectangle the shape of a door.  Divide the "door" into eight rows (A-H) and columns (1-8), the lower right corner grid cell code is "A1" and the upper left corner grid cell code is "H8".  Each grid cell represents a USGS 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle, hence sixty-four per one-degree rectangle.  Each USGS 1:100,000 topographic quadrangle is one-half by one degree with only two fitting within the one-degree rectangle-the upper half and the lower half of the "door".  The lower quadrangle's grid cell code is "A1" and the upper quadrangle's grid cell code is "E1" (these are the only grid cell codes for USGS 1:100,000 topographic quadrangles).  Each USGS 1:250,000 topographic quadrangle is one by two degrees, which, is two "doors" side by side.  The quadrangle's grid cell code is "A1" (this is the only grid cell code for USGS 1:250,000 topographic quadrangles).</attrdef>        <attrdefs>United States Geological Survey as interpreted and described by ESRI</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <codesetd>            <codesetn>USGS Topographic Names Database, Published Map Sheet Data File (T-70)</codesetn>            <codesets>United States Geological Survey</codesets>          </codesetd>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>QUAD_NAME</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The quadrangle name.</attrdef>        <attrdefs>United States Geological Survey</attrdefs>        <attrdomv>          <udom>Names for the features.</udom>        </attrdomv>      </attr>      <attr>        <attrlabl>MAP_EDIT</attrlabl>        <attrdef>The type of map for the quadrangle.
