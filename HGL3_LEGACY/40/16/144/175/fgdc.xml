The sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the early 1980's. The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale and 1:2,000,000-scale BLM state base maps. These data were published on CD- ROM in 1995 as State tiles in DLG optional format. Using Arc/INFO software, the updated DLG optional format files were converted to Arc/INFO coverages using the DLGARC command. The numeric DLG attribute codes were translated to their text equivalents. For example, the DLG code '097 0363' was translated to 'National Park NPS'. Only land and attribute information were extracted for inclusion. Proper names were added to specific Federal lands. The States were then paneled together with the APPEND command. "Slivers" created during the paneling process were identified and deleted using the ELIMINATE command. The attribute AGBUR, which contains the name of the owning or administering agency or bureau, was added for plotting purposes. The data were converted to shapefile format for use in National Atlas applications and for distribution to the public. This produced the Federal Land Features of the U.S. (polygon) 1997.In 1998, topological errors introduced when the State files were paneled were corrected. Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was added. Coding of Lake Tahoe was corrected, and Fort Frederica, GA was deleted because it was smaller than the minimum area of 640 acres.The URL for Glacier National Park was corrected. This produced the Federal Land Features of the U.S. (polygon) 1998.Several new federal lands were established since 1998. Those that meet the minimum mapping criterion of 640 acres (1 square mile) were added.</procdesc>        <procdate>2000</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView GIS Shapefile compressed file, fedlanp020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it. Combined attributes FEATURE1, 2, 3, AGBUR, NAME1, 2, 3, STATE, and STATE_FIPS into a single attribute, summarized and dissolved on that attribute to reduce the number of features. Joined the tables to get back the original attributes. Removed unneeded attributes. Removed null records. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.
