Wyman Commo. U.S.N. Hydrographer to the Bureau of Navigation ; eng. by Sherman &amp; Smith, N.Y. It was published by the United States Hydrographic Office in 1889. Ed. of Mar. 1889.  This dataset is georeferenced for the map entitled: Apia, Apaiang, or Charlotte Island, Kingsmill Group / by the U. S. Ex. Ex. 1841 ; additions by the U.S. Ship Narragansett, Comdr. R. W. Meade comd'g 1872. Scale [ca. 1:150,000]. Covers Abaiang Atoll, Kiribati. The original map contains multiple maps on one sheet. Because the map images are non-contiguous and possibly at differing scales, each map image was georeferenced separately. Please see the 'cross references' section for other maps on this sheet.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'Mercator' projection.  All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any ancillary maps, inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows shoreline features such as islets, sand banks, entrances, and more. Depths shown by soundings.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract><purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1889</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>source map publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>172.527168</westbc><eastbc>173.331270</eastbc><northbc>2.160177</northbc><southbc>1.072346</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>LCSH</themekt><themekey>Maps</themekey><themekey>Nautical charts</themekey><themekey>Islands</themekey><themekey>Coral reefs and islands</themekey><themekey>Landforms</themekey><themekey>Bodies of water</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey></theme><place><placekt>GNS (NIMA)</placekt><placekey>Kiribati</placekey><placekey>Southern Gilbert Islands</placekey><placekey>Abaiang Atoll</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard Map Collection</address><address>Pusey Library</address><address>Harvard University</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></ptcontac><native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3</native><crossref><citeinfo><origin>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</origin><origin>Harvard University.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The Root Mean Squared (RMS) error for this map is 452.64393 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>United States.

Loose and bound maps for the OCP Exploration project were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. For proofing purposes, original materials were evaluated using GTI EVS viewing booths. Images were evaluated using calibrated Eizo ColorEdge monitors. Tonal and color corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Master Image files were corrected and archived in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc><srcused>Paper Map</srcused><procdate>2008-2009</procdate><srcprod>JP2 Map Download Image</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>D-Level, Room D-30</address><address>Widener Library</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>A new version of the JPEG2000 image was created for online display in the Harvard Geospatial Library.  Because the original image consists of multiple views of geographically non-contiguous islands, it was necessary to digitally clip the image in order to provide for online viewing.  This display version is not distributed for download.  Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the JPEG2000 image was clipped using the Raster Clip tool in ArcToolbox.  Each clipped image was then georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefile was used as a base map for reference:  "Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline Database, version 1.3" from the National Geophysical Data Center.  The vector data was projected to the 'World Mercator' projection and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.  A world file (.j2w) was automatically generated and saved in association with the image.</procdesc><srcused>JP2 Map Download Image</srcused><procdate>2008-2009</procdate><srcprod>JP2 Map Display Image</srcprod><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>Harvard University Library</address><address>Office for Information Systems</address><address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address><city>Cambridge</city><state>MA</state><postal>02138</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice><cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax><cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail><hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>The version available for download through the Harvard Geospatial Library was georeferenced using the following process steps:Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.
