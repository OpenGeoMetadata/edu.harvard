Using the airport.pnt and airport.t01 files on the CD-ROM, airports with passenger enplanement of greater than or equal to 250 passengers per year were selected to create a point coverage to which the following attributes were attached: airport location identifier, name of airport, name of State, State FIPS code, Air Carrier Activity Information System airports, and Total Enplanement. The data were converted to shapefile format for use in National Atlas applications and for distribution to the public.Airports for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added. Airport names were changed from all upper case and no period after initials to lower case and period after initials. For example, LYNDON B JOHNSON is now Lyndon B. Johnson. Airports of the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 1999 was updated with enplanement data from National Transportation Atlas Databases 2001 (NTAD-2001). Existing airports, heliports, and seaplane bases with enplanements of 250 or greater were kept in the data set, while those below 250 enplanements were deleted. Sixty-five airports, heliports, and seaplane bases that had 250 or greater enplanements were added. The following attributes were added to Airports of the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 1999: Feature, indicating the type of facility, name of County, and County FIPS code.</procdesc>        <procdate>20010805</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView GIS Shapefile compressed file, airprtx020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it.

Added attribute ACAIS and coded it from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. National Atlas Airports and FAA CY1999 ACAIS data base.
