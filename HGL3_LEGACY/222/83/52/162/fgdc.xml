Compilation date: 1953. Printed in: 1962. Covers portions of Aoulef region, Algeria.Map quadrangle number: NG 31-5.  Edition statement:  Ed. 1 - AMS.Compiled in 1953 from: Carte du Sahara, 1:200,000, Institut Geographique National, Sheets NG-31 XIII, 1929, NG-31 XIV, 1931; Afrique, 1:500,000, Institut Geographique National, Sheet NG-31 NW, 1950.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to World Geodetic System (1984) coordinates. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image. Series source sheets are of varying compilation dates (1951-1964) and editions, published by the Army Map Service.AMS Series P502 maps are in English. Each source map in the series is printed in color at a scale of 1:250,000. The source map was selected and downloaded from the University of Texas Libraries Web site by the Harvard University Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) and georeferenced for the CGA's AfricaMap project by East View Cartographic. Individual AMS sheets covering a small portion of Africa (146 sheets in total) were selected from AMS series of: North Africa (P502), West Africa (G504), and South Africa (Z501).AMS Series maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc.  They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc.  Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 50 meters, with some sheets having supplemental meter contours, form lines, hachures, shading, and/or spot heights. Depths shown by bathymetric isolines.Please pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, planimetric revision methods and dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic topographic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1953</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map compilation date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-0.117174</westbc>        <eastbc>1.778125</eastbc>        <northbc>27.102077</northbc>        <southbc>25.789689</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps, Topographic</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>        <themekey>Landforms</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNS</placekt>        <placekey>Algeria</placekey>        <placekey>Aoulef</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Center for Geographic Analysis</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <address>CGIS K-00A</address>          <address>CGIS Knafel Building</address>          <address>1737 Cambridge St.</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntemail>contact@help.cga.harvard.edu</cntemail>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <datacred>Image source: Courtesy of the University of Texas Libraries, The University of Texas at Austin.</datacred>    <native>Microsoft Windows 2000 Version 5.0 (Build 2195) Service Pack 4; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.0.0.535</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.With AMS sheets: Road classification should be referred to with caution.  Relief data is not always complete.  International boundaries are not considered authoritative. Names for symbolized populated places are omitted where information is not available or where density of detail does not permit their inclusion.Some sheets in the series include a reliability diagram in the collar detailing sources and methods used to compile data, reliability by geography, and areas for which vegetation information is available.</attraccr>    </attracc>    <logic>Not applicable.</logic>    <complete>Data completeness for raster image files reflect content of the source graphic.  Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints.</complete>    <posacc>      <horizpa>        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic. While the data of the published map is retained in the georeferenced image, the image is referenced to the World Geographic Reference 1984 system, which is inconsistent with the original projection of the paper map, and may lead to discrepancies in the horizontal accuracy of the raster image.The Root Mean Square (RMS) error for this map is 44.9826 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>        <qhorizpa>          <horizpav>50 meters</horizpav>          <horizpae>1:250,000 Army Map Service</horizpae>        </qhorizpa>      </horizpa>      <vertacc>        <vertaccr>Refer to the raster image collar for information about vertical positional accuracy.</vertaccr>      </vertacc>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>United States.

They also use a Contex Chroma TX 40" wide format scanner for some map formats. Color correction, compositing and image processing operations are performed in Adobe Photoshop CS2.Over the years, the approach to scanning for the Map Collection site has evolved. The earliest scans were on a Apple Color One Scanner. Later, they used a Microtek Scan Maker 9800 XL on a Macintosh G4. In the early years of the site, they scanned maps at 150 to 200 dpi. Currently, they usually scan items at a minimum of 400 dpi. Depending on the content/size/smallest detail of the map they will increase that up 800 dpi and on occasion resolution is decreased down to 200 dpi for less detailed maps.The AMS series maps are 400 dpi.Maps are presented as they were originally published. The original publisher/source and date of the maps are provided on the University of Texas Libraries web pages.
