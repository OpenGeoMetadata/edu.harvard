The map is [sheet 22] from the Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England, from surveys taken by Samuel Holland and published by J.F.W. Des Barres, 1781. Scale [ca. 1:25,000]. This layer is image 2 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the eastern portion of the map. Covers portion of Boston Harbor, Massachusetts and surrounding towns. The image is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Mercator' (WGS 84) projected coordinate system. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more.  Includes also selected land features such as cities and towns, roads, fortifications, and buildings. Relief is shown by hachures; depths by soundings and shading. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection.  The entire Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England has been scanned and georeferenced as part of this selection.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1775</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-71.000821</westbc>        <eastbc>-70.801963</eastbc>        <northbc>42.432801</northbc>        <southbc>42.236115</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Nautical charts</themekey>        <themekey>Coasts</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>        <themekey>Harbors</themekey>        <themekey>Hydrography</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Cities and towns</themekey>        <themekey>Landforms</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>        <themekey>transportation</themekey>        <themekey>oceans</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNIS</placekt>        <placekey>Atlantic Ocean</placekey>        <placekey>Massachusetts</placekey>        <placekey>Boston Harbor</placekey>        <placekey>Boston</placekey>        <placekey>Hingham</placekey>        <placekey>Hull</placekey>        <placekey>Nahant</placekey>        <placekey>Quincy</placekey>        <placekey>Revere</placekey>        <placekey>Winthrop</placekey>        <placekey>Weymouth</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard University Library</address>          <address>Office For Information Systems</address>          <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.4.1420</native>    <crossref>      <citeinfo>        <origin>Des Barres, Joseph F.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 290.31385 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Des Barres, Joseph F.

Digital images of from the Harvard Map Collection were created by Harvard College Library Imaging Services in 2008. Maps were photographed at a copy stand. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed in Adobe Photoshop. Subjective color and contrasting editing was performed at the discretion of the photographer. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the Adobe RGB (1988) or sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-spaces, at the photographer's discretion. The imaging specification for the "delivery" JPEG2000 images was designed to produce images optimized for variable size viewing on the Web. These delivery images were derived in batches from sharpened versions of the "archival master" files, and converted and tagged with the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 colorspace profile (ICC). The colorspace tag is used to assure that color and tonal information is properly displayed across multiple systems and media.Image resolution is of sufficient quality to render all meaningful map details on screen and in print; Format is 24 bit TIFF, uncompressed; Tone/color reproduction: embedded ICC (International Color Consortium) profile with associated size and tone reference. Quality control: visual inspection, MD5 checksum for 100% of images.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2008</procdate>        <srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.2 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used for reference and linking:  NOAA Medium Resolution Digital Vector Shoreline (1:70,000) (data released in 1994). In addition to vector data, this image was also linked to other georeferenced maps including: Des Barres' A chart of the harbour of Boston, 1775, [sheet 21] of the Atlantic Neptune atlas. The vector data was projected to the 'World Mercator' projected coordinate system, and the images were subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.  A world file (.tfwx) and an '.aux.xml' file were automatically generated and saved in association with the digital TIFF image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this TIFF image. Please note that while the image is stored in 'World Mercator' coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>        <srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused>        <procdate>200803</procdate>        <srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Raster</direct>    <rastinfo>      <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>      <rowcount>10038</rowcount>      <colcount>7720</colcount>      <vrtcount>1</vrtcount>    </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <mapproj>          <mapprojn>Mercator</mapprojn>          <mercator>            <stdparll>0.000000</stdparll>            <longcm>0.000000</longcm>            <feast>0.000000</feast>            <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>          </mercator>        </mapproj>        <planci>          <plance>row and column</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>2.867465</absres>            <ordres>2.939856</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>meters</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn>        <ellips>WGS_1984</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>298.257224</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <overview>      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
