The sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the early 1980's. The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale and 1:2,000,000-scale Bureau of Land Management state base maps.  These data were published on CD-ROM in 1995.  Using ARC/INFO software, the DLG optional format files were converted to ARC/INFO coverages using the DLGARC command. Only federal land polygons and attribute information were extracted for inclusion.  The sections were then paneled together using the ARC/INFO command APPEND.  "Slivers" created during the append process were identified and deleted using the ELIMINATE command.  The attribute AGBUR was added for plotting purposes. The codes used are: BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs), BOR (Bureau of Reclamation), BLM (Bureau of Land Management), DOD (Department of Defense), FS (Forest Service), FWS (Fish and Wildlife Service), NPS (National Park Service), TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority), and OTHER.  In 1998, topological errors introduced when the state files were paneled were corrected.  Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was added.  Coding of Lake Tahoe was corrected, and Fort Frederica, GA was deleted because it was smaller than the minimum area of 640 acres.  The data were converted to shapefile format for use in National Atlas applications and for distribution to the public.  One or more of the following methods tested accuracy at the DLG level: - Manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots. - Symbolized display of the digital line graph (DLG) on an interactive computer graphic system. - Selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.  As the DLG files were directly converted to ARC/INFO coverages, attributes have not been checked in the ARC/INFO format. - The files underwent comparison to a graphic source or image source that was used as control to assess digital positional accuracy.  During conversion to ARC/INFO coverage format and during the append process to panel the states together, node snapping and fuzzy tolerances may have caused minimal positional shifts.  Revisions: 1) 3/22/98 - Corrected topological problems along state lines, corrected coding errors (Lake Tahoe), and added Escalante national monument.  State attribute codes were removed.  Fort Frederica, GA was deleted because it was below the minimum mapping area of 640 acres. 2) 6/17/98 - Corrected URL for Glacier National Park. 3) 6/29/98 - Corrected ellipsoid name from WGS84 to GRS1980 and changed flattening ratio.</procdesc>        <procdate>19980629</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView Shapefile version of the data, fedlanp020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it.
