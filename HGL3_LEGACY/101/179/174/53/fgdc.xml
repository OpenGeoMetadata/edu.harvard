The eastern States were collected from existing 1:100,000-scale USGS topographic sheets base maps. Data from both sources were integrated into 1:2,000,000 State-level DLG files, then generalized and vertically integrated with 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph Data - Boundaries, County Boundaries of the United States, and Hydrography Features of the United States. The resulting Public Land Survey System DLG files were published on CD-ROM in 1995. The DLG optional-format files were then converted to Arc/INFO coverages, and the individual State files were paneled together into a national coverage. Numeric DLG codes were translated into English, non-polygon features were deleted, and the data set was converted to shapefile format.Township and Range values were corrected in the Boise, Copper River, Fifth Principal, Fourth Principal, Sixth Principal, Indian, Louisiana, Salt Lake, St. Stephens, Third Principal, Umiat, and Willamette surveys. In all, 250 corrections were made using 1:100,000-scale USGS topographic sheets base maps. Some polygons in coastal areas were added or deleted to accurately portray the extent of a Township or unsurveyed area.</procdesc>        <procdate>200204</procdate>        <srcprod>National Atlas</srcprod>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView GIS Shapefile compressed file, plss00p020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it.
