Picquet. It was published by Ch. Piquet, Geographie ordinaire du Roi et de S.A.S. Monseig.r le Duc d'Orleans in [1880]. Scale [1:25,000]. Covers the Paris, France Region. Map in French.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to ESRI's 'France I' NTF Paris coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, villages and towns, built-up areas, selected buildings and names of landowners, ground cover, and more. Relief is shown by hachures and spot heights.  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project.  Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods.  These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>      <supplinf>Please be aware that the 'France I' projected coordinate system, as defined by ESRI, uses Paris as the Prime Meridian, and uses grads, not degrees, for angular measurement.  If you need to alter the spatial reference of this image, a transformation into another projected coordinate system may prove difficult, as not all software projection tools (including ArcToolbox 9.3) successfully support datum transformations between NTF_Paris and other datums.</supplinf>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1880</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>1.790</westbc>        <eastbc>2.917</eastbc>        <northbc>49.087</northbc>        <southbc>48.619</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Cities and towns</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Landforms</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNS (NIMA)</placekt>        <placekey>France</placekey>        <placekey>Paris</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard Map Collection</address>          <address>Pusey Library</address>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.2</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  For instance, this map contains grid-like seams that are the result of being formerly folded as a booklet.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  For instance, this raster image was georeferenced to another georeferenced image, which may have its own positional inaccuracies (see "Process Steps").  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 204.6013 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Picquet, Charles.</origin>            <pubdate>1880</pubdate>            <title>Environs de Paris</title>            <geoform>map</geoform>            <pubinfo>              <pubplace>Paris</pubplace>              <publish>Ch.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed using Adobe Photoshop.  Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2007</procdate>        <srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.2 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on the following scanned, georeferenced paper maps from the Institut Geographique National  (IGN) TOP 25 1:25,000 topographic series (published in the 1990s): Paris 2314 OT (1), TOP25 Foret de Montmorency 2313 OT (1), TOP25 Palaiseau Arpajon 2315 OT (1), TOP25 Marne-La_Vallee 2414 ET (1), TOP25 Evry Melun 2415 OT (1), TOP25 Et Versailles 2214 ET (2), TOP25 Foret de Rambouillet 2215 OT (2), TOP25 Dammartin-en-Goele 2413 OT (1).  This (These) quadrangle(s) was (were) scanned at 300 dpi and then georeferenced to the four corner latitude, longitude tic marks defined in ESRI's 'France I' NTF Paris coordinate system.  The RMS error for the above-listed map(s) is (are) 12.29436, 9.55255, 6.49252, 7.25284, 3.62643, 7.34401, 1.72342, 8.88185 meters, respectively. A world file (.tfwx) and an .aux.xml file were automatically generated and saved in association with the digital TIFF image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this specific TIFF.Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.Additionally, please be aware that the 'France I' projected coordinate system, as defined by ESRI, uses Paris as the Prime Meridian, and uses grads, not degrees, for angular measurement.
