To display a grid with a 1-degree interval, simply display all of the lines. To display a coarser grid (e.g., a 15-degree interval), in the Layer Properties dialog box, add the DEGREE15 attribute value equal to Y.</abstract><purpose>World Latitude and Longitude Grids provides latitude and longitude lines for use as an overlay for world-level maps.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><mdattim><sngdate><caldate>20100630</caldate></sngdate><sngdate><caldate>201011</caldate></sngdate></mdattim></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Annually</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-180.000000</westbc><eastbc>180.000000</eastbc><northbc>90.000000</northbc><southbc>-90.000000</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>LCSH</themekt><themekey>Grides(Cartography)</themekey><themekey>Coordinates</themekey><themekey>Latitude</themekey><themekey>Longitude</themekey><themekey>World Maps</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>location</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>Line</themekey><themekey>Latitudes</themekey><themekey>Longitudes</themekey><themekey>Grids</themekey><themekey>Location</themekey></theme><place><placekt>LCSH</placekt><placekey>Earth</placekey><placekey>Northern Hemisphere</placekey><placekey>Southern Hemisphere</placekey><placekey>Eastern Hemisphere</placekey><placekey>Western Hemisphere</placekey><placekey>Africa</placekey><placekey>Asia</placekey><placekey>Australia</placekey><placekey>Europe</placekey><placekey>North America</placekey><placekey>South America</placekey></place><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>World</placekey></place><temporal><tempkt>None</tempkt><tempkey>2010</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>Access granted to Licensee only.</accconst><useconst>The data are provided under the Harvard University Site License.
