Clarke, arch[t]; engraved by J. Henshall. It was published by published under the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge [by] Charles Knight in 1850. Scale [ca. 1:12,000]. Covers Bordeaux, France.  The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'European Datum 1950 UTM 30N' projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.This map shows features such as roads, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortification, ground cover, parks, and more. Depths shown by soundings. Includes views and index.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project.  Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods.  These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>    </descript>    <timeperd>      <timeinfo>        <sngdate>          <caldate>1850</caldate>        </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <current>source map publication date</current>    </timeperd>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding>        <westbc>-0.603688</westbc>        <eastbc>-0.535002</eastbc>        <northbc>44.871489</northbc>        <southbc>44.816942</southbc>      </bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>LCSH</themekt>        <themekey>Maps</themekey>        <themekey>Human settlements</themekey>        <themekey>Cities and towns</themekey>        <themekey>Land use</themekey>        <themekey>Landforms</themekey>        <themekey>Infrastructure (Economics)</themekey>        <themekey>Transportation</themekey>        <themekey>Bodies of water</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>GNS</placekt>        <placekey>France</placekey>        <placekey>Bordeaux</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>For educational, non-commercial use only.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Harvard Map Collection, Harvard College Library</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>          <address>Harvard Map Collection</address>          <address>Pusey Library</address>          <address>Harvard University</address>          <city>Cambridge</city>          <state>MA</state>          <postal>02138</postal>          <country>USA</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>        <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>        <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>        <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <native>ESRI ArcGIS 9.3</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>    <attracc>      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map.

The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  For instance, this raster image was georeferenced to another georeferenced image, which may have its own positional inaccuracies (see "Process Steps").  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The Root Mean Squared (RMS) error for this map is 5.96492 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>      </horizpa>    </posacc>    <lineage>      <srcinfo>        <srccite>          <citeinfo>            <origin>Clarke, W.

Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were processed Adobe Photoshop. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc>        <srcused>Paper Map</srcused>        <procdate>2008-2009</procdate>        <srcprod>TIFF Map Image</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard College Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>Digital Imaging and Photography Group</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>D-Level, Room D-30</address>              <address>Widener Library</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2030</cntvoice>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>      <procstep>        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on the following scanned, georeferenced paper map from the Institut Geographique Serie Bleue 1:25,000 topographic series published in 1995:  Bordeaux 1:25,000.  This quadrangle was scanned at 300 dpi and then georeferenced to the four corner latitude, longitude tic marks defined in ESRI's 'France III' coordinate system with an RMS error of 2.99442 meters.  The TIFF image of the historic map was subsequently georeferenced to the above-listed map using the 'European Datum 1950 UTM 30N' projected coordinate system.  A world file (.tfw) was automatically generated and saved in association with the image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image.  Please note that after the image is downloaded, the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image and the UTM projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data.</procdesc>        <srcused>TIFF Map Image</srcused>        <procdate>201002</procdate>        <srcprod>Georeferenced Raster Data</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>Harvard Geospatial Library</cntorg>            </cntorgp>            <cntpos>GIS Technician</cntpos>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>Harvard University Library</address>              <address>Office for Information Systems</address>              <address>90 Mount Auburn Street</address>              <city>Cambridge</city>              <state>MA</state>              <postal>02138</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>617-495-2417</cntvoice>            <cntfax>617-496-0440</cntfax>            <cntemail>hgl_ref@hulmail.harvard.edu</cntemail>            <hours>Monday - Friday, 9:00 am - 4:00 pm EST-USA</hours>          </cntinfo>        </proccont>      </procstep>    </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>    <direct>Raster</direct>    <rastinfo>      <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype>      <rowcount>4398</rowcount>      <colcount>5216</colcount>      <vrtcount>1</vrtcount>    </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>    <horizsys>      <planar>        <gridsys>          <gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn>          <utm>            <utmzone>30</utmzone>            <transmer>              <sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer>              <longcm>-3.000000</longcm>              <latprjo>0.000000</latprjo>              <feast>500000.000000</feast>              <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>            </transmer>          </utm>        </gridsys>        <planci>          <plance>row and column</plance>          <coordrep>            <absres>1.007760</absres>            <ordres>1.343263</ordres>          </coordrep>          <plandu>meters</plandu>        </planci>      </planar>      <geodetic>        <horizdn>D_European_1950</horizdn>        <ellips>International_1924</ellips>        <semiaxis>6378388.000000</semiaxis>        <denflat>297.000000</denflat>      </geodetic>    </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>    <overview>      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map.
