Joined each data set to its respective correspondence table to get NUTS 0, NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3 codes into each data set. Added the BND_SOURCE attribute to both data sets populating it in the EuroGeographics boundary data with "EuroGeographics" and in the AND Global Road Data with "AND Data Solutions".Combined the two data sets into one. Went through the NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3 codes for each country and changed the code to its NUTS 0 code if that country had no lower levels. For example, if all NUTS 2 codes for Danmark were "DK00", then they were changed to "DK". If a country didn't have data for a particular level of NUTS, then all records for that country got the NUTS 0 code for that level.Dissolved the data set into four data sets of NUTS 0, NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3 and corrected any problems. Joined the attribute data from Michael Bauer Research GmbH to each of the four data sets.For data sets NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3, put "-99" values into the number attributes and blank values into the PP_CATEGOR and PP_INCNTRY attributes for all records with a NUTS 0 code, since there was no data for that level. Due to a lack of boundary information, five NUTS units couldn't be subdivided into the next lower level. Added the SQKM attribute to each of the four data sets and calculated its values. Finalized the attribute names, widths, and order in each data set. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices for each data set.</procdesc>        <srcused>MBR and EuroGeographics</srcused>        <srcused>AND Global Road Data</srcused>        <procdate>20050329</procdate>        <srcprod>SDC</srcprod>        <proccont>          <cntinfo>            <cntorgp>              <cntorg>ESRI</cntorg>              <cntper>Data Team</cntper>            </cntorgp>            <cntaddr>              <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>              <address>380 New York Street</address>              <city>Redlands</city>              <state>California</state>              <postal>92373-8100</postal>              <country>USA</country>            </cntaddr>            <cntvoice>909-793-2853</cntvoice>            <cntfax>909-793-5953</cntfax>            <cntemail>info@esri.com</cntemail>            <hours>8:00 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Pacific time, Monday-Friday</hours>            <cntinst>In the United States-Please direct all inquiries regarding software/data pricing and consulting services to your local ESRI Regional Office.
