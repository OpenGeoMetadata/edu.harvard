Selected and kept all interstates, major thoroughfares and any other road segments needed to represent the major drive patterns depicted in a typical highway road atlas. Several features had no route name and were given values from its neighboring features or by referencing the National Geographic Road Atlas. Corrected hundreds of gaps in the road network. Generalized to a tolerance of 0.003 decimal degrees. Added attributes CLASS, NUMBER, and SUFFIX from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways based on the ROUTE_NUM attribute. Unsplit features based on combining all attributes. Added and calculated attributes DIST_MILES and DIST_KM. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.
